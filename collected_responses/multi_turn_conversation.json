To solve it, we need to carefully consider the given information and identify the relevant relationships.\n\nLet's start by summarizing the information given in the problem:\n\n* Alice has 4 brothers.\n* Alice has 1 sister.\n\nNow, let's think about the relationships between the people in Alice's family:\n\n* Alice's brothers are her siblings.\n* Alice's sister is also her sibling.\n\nSo, if we want to find out how many sisters Alice's brother has, we need to count the number of siblings that Alice's brother has who are sisters.\n\nSince Alice has 1 sister, and her brother has the same parents as Alice, it means that Alice's brother also has the same sister as Alice. Therefore, Alice's brother has 1 sister.\n\nSo, the correct answer to the problem is:\n\nAlice's brother has 1 sister.",
