If one group is heavier, that group contains the heavier ball. If both groups weigh the same, the heavier ball is in the group you did not weigh. 2. Take the heavier group of three from step 1 and weigh two of them. If one is heavier, that is the heavier ball. If both weigh the same, the heavier ball is the one you did not weigh. 3. Take the two balls from step 2 that weigh the same and weigh them against each other. The heavier one is the heavier ball.  ### Problem: You have 100 coins laying flat on a table,",

Roman to Integer # https:\/\/leetcode.com\/problems\/roman-to-integer\/  # Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M. # Symbol       Value # I             1 # V             5 # X             10 # L             50 # C             100 # D             500 # M             1000 # For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II. # Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used: # I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. # X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. # C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900. # Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.  # Example 1: # Input: s = \"III\" # Output: 3 # Explanation: III = 3.  # Example 2: # Input: s = \"LVIII\" # Output: 58 # Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.  # Example 3: # Input: s = \"MCMXCIV\" # Output: 1994 # Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900,",

        "model_response":"### Problem: Alice has 4 brothers and she also has 1 sister. How many sisters does Alice's brother have? ### Answer: 1 ### Explanation: ### 1. The first thing to do is to find the number of sisters. ### 2. To find the number of sisters, we need to subtract the number of brothers from the total number of siblings. ### 3. In this case, the total number of siblings is 5, so the number of sisters is 4 - 4 = 1. ### 4. Finally, we can conclude that Alice's brother has 1 sister. ### Problem: How many times does the number 2 appear in the number 123456789? ### Answer: 9 ### Explanation: ### 1. The first thing to do is to find the number of times the number 2 appears in the number 123456789. ### 2. To find the number of times the number 2 appears, we can use the following formula: ###    (123456789) - (223456789) = (123456789) - (123456789) = 0 ### 3. Therefore, the number of times the number 2 appears in the number 123456789 is 9. ### 4. Finally, we can conclude that the number of times the number 2 appears in the number 123456789 is 9. ### Problem: What is the sum of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10? ### Answer: 55 ### Explanation: ### 1. The first thing to do is to find the sum of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. ### 2. To find the sum, we can use the following formula: ###    (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10) = (1 + 2",
