The number of their children (Alice's maternal cousins) is not specified, so we'll assume they have no children unless stated otherwise.  3. **Father's Siblings:**    - Alice's father has 2 sisters (paternal aunts) and 1 brother (paternal uncle).    - The paternal uncle has:      - 1 son.      - 1 nephew and 3 nieces (these are Alice's cousins from the father's side).     4. **Sister Without Children:**    - One of Alice's sisters does not have children but has 2 nephews and 4 nieces. These nephews and nieces are Alice's children from her own siblings, not her cousins.  5. **Calculating Cousins:**    - **From Mother's Side:** 2 maternal uncles with no specified children.    - **From Father's Side:**       - Paternal aunt 1: No children specified.      - Paternal aunt 2: No children specified.      - Paternal uncle: 1 son.      - Additionally, from the uncle's nephews and nieces: 1 nephew + 3 nieces = 4.  Combining the father's side: - Paternal uncle's son: 1 - Nephew and nieces: 4  Total cousins from the father's side: 5.  Assuming the maternal uncles have no children, Alice's sister has **5 cousins**.  ### Answer: 5",

These nephews and nieces come from her siblings S2 and B1.    - Therefore, S2 and B1 have a combined total of 6 children (2 nephews and 4 nieces).  3. **Uncle (Father\u2019s Brother) F3:**    - **F3** has 1 son.    - **F3** also has 1 nephew and 3 nieces from his siblings' children (which are part of the main family, i.e., Alice and her siblings).  4. **Cousins Calculation:**    - Cousins come from the children of one's aunts and uncles.    - From the **father's side**, F3 (the brother) has 1 son, which is the only cousin explicitly mentioned.    - There is no information provided about the children of the mother's brothers or the father's sisters, so we assume there are no additional cousins from those sides.  Therefore, **S1** has **1 cousin** from her father's brother.  ### Answer: 1",
