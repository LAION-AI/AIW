        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's carefully consider the information provided step by step.  - **Alice and Bob are friends.** - **Alice has 2 male friends.**     - Since Alice is friends with Bob (who is male), Bob must be one of these two male friends.     - This means there is one other male friend besides Bob. Let's call him **Male1**. - **Bob has 5 female friends.**     - Since Bob is friends with Alice (who is female), Alice must be one of these five female friends.     - This means there are four other female friends besides Alice. Let's call them **Female1**, **Female2**, **Female3**, and **Female4**. - **All mentioned persons are friends with each other and have no other friends aside.**  So, the total group consists of: - **2 males:** Bob and Male1 - **5 females:** Alice, Female1, Female2, Female3, Female4  Since all are friends with each other, Alice's friends are: - **Bob** (male) - **Male1** (male) - **Female1** (female) - **Female2** (female) - **Female3** (female) - **Female4** (female)  Therefore, the number of female friends Alice has is **4** (Female1, Female2, Female3, Female4).  ### Answer: 4",
