The statement says, \"Alice has 6 sisters,\" which implies that there are 6 other girls besides Alice.    - **Total Sisters:** 6 (Alice's sisters) + 1 (Alice herself) = **7 sisters** in total.  3. **Sisters per Brother:**    - Each of Alice's brothers shares the same set of sisters.    - Therefore, **each brother has 7 sisters.**  ### Answer: 7",
