        "model_response":"To determine how many cousins Alice's sister has, let's break down the information step by step:  1. **Alice and Her Siblings:**    - Alice has **3 sisters**, making a total of **4 daughters** in her immediate family.  2. **Mother's Side:**    - **Mother's Siblings:**      - Mother has **1 sister (maternal aunt)** who **does not have children**.      - Mother also has **2 brothers**.    - **Nephews and Nieces from Mother's Side:**      - Since the maternal aunt has no children, all nephews and nieces come from the mother's brothers.      - It's stated that the mother has **7 nephews and nieces**. These are Alice's cousins from her mother's side.  3. **Father's Side:**    - **Father's Siblings:**      - Father has **1 brother (paternal uncle)**.    - **Nephews and Nieces from Father's Side:**      - The paternal uncle has **5 nephews and nieces**.      - These nephews and nieces are Alice's cousins from her father's side.  4. **Total Cousins:**    - **From Mother's Side:** 7 cousins    - **From Father's Side:** 5 cousins    - **Total Cousins:** 7 + 5 = **12 cousins**  ### Answer: 12",
