Let's break it down:  1. **Alice's Immediate Family:**    - Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother.  2. **Alice's Mother's Side:**    - Alice's mother has 2 brothers.    - Alice's mother also has a sister who does not have children.    - The total of 6 nephews and nieces mentioned in relation to Alice's mother's sister must hence be Alice and her siblings (3), and the children of her mother's 2 brothers. Therefore, the 2 brothers must have 3 children in total (6 - 3 of Alice and her siblings).  3. **Alice's Father's Side:**    - Alice's father has 2 sisters.    - Alice's father also has a brother who has 5 nephews and nieces (in this context, it includes Alice and her siblings).      - Alice and her siblings count as 4 nephews and nieces.      - Alice's father's brother has 1 son, as specified.  Combining the information from both sides of her family:  - The children of Alice's mother's brothers (mother's side) contribute 3 cousins. - Alice's uncle on her father's side does not increase the count of cousins because his son is already counted in the nephew\/niece tally, but not additional to the nephews and nieces.  So in total, the cousins:  - 3 cousins from Alice's mother's brothers' children.  Thus, Alice's sister has 3 cousins.  ### Answer: 3",

Hence, Alice\u2019s cousins on both sides are: - 2 cousins from her mother's side. - 1 cousin from her father's side.  Adding them together gives Alice a total of 3 cousins.

We know that alice plus 2 sisters and 1 brother make it 4 children in Alice's family and Alice's maternal aunt considers Alice and her siblings as nephews and nieces (6 children, 4 of them from Alice\u2019s mother).  3. **Father\u2019s Side:**    - Alice's father has 2 sisters.      - We are not given any information about Alice's paternal aunts' children, so we cannot count any cousins from this side based on the information given.    - He also has a brother who has 5 nephews and nieces in total and has 1 son.      - The 5 nephews and nieces consist of Alice and her siblings (Alice + 2 sisters + 1 brother = 4). This covers the 4 children of Alice\u2019s father considered as nephews and nieces by their paternal uncle. The total 4 doesn't meet the total 5.      - This discrepancy might be misunderstood initially, since only Alice, and her 3 siblings, would only mean 4 as already family of Alice, 1 more child from uncle\u2019s another sibling in uncle\u2019s brother family besides Alice\u2019s children.

These brothers are Alice's maternal uncles.  3. **Alice's Mother\u2019s Sister**:    - Alice's mother also has 1 sister (Alice's maternal aunt) who does not have children.  4. **Alice's Mother\u2019s Nephews and Nieces**:    - Alice\u2019s maternal uncle(s) (2) have a combined total of 6 nephews and nieces. Since Alice and her siblings are included in this count, we must determine how many of them are from her mother's side.    - Alice and her siblings (3, as calculated previously) are part of this count.     - Therefore, the total number of children from Alice\u2019s mother's brothers must be 6. Since Alice has 3 siblings, the additional nephews and nieces must come from her uncles.    - This means they must have 3 children together (which are Alice and her siblings), leading to: Total nephews and nieces from the mother's brothers = 6 - 3 = 3 of Alice's cousins from her mother's side.  5. **Alice's Father**:    - Alice's father has 2 sisters. These sisters are Alice's paternal aunts.  6. **Alice's Father's Brother**:    - Alice\u2019s father has a brother who has 5 nephews and nieces in total. Alice and her siblings are part of this count.    - Total children from Alice\u2019s father = 3 (Alice + 2 sisters + 1 brother). Hence, this uncle has 5 - 3 = 2 of Alice's cousins from her father's side.  7. **Calculating Total Cousins**:    - Alice has 3 cousins from her maternal uncles and 2 cousins from her paternal uncle.    - Therefore, the total number of cousins Alice has = 3 (from mother's side) + 2 (from father's side) = 5 cousins.  8. **Cousins Count for Alice's Sister**:    - Since Alice's sister shares the same set of cousins, she also has the same number of cousins as Alice.

Since Aunt 1 does not have children, these nephews and nieces must be the children of Alice's mother's 2 brothers.    - Therefore, Alice's 2 uncles must have children that contribute to the 6 total nephews and nieces.  4. **Alice's Father's Side**:    - Alice's father has 2 sisters.    - He also has 1 brother who has 5 nephews and nieces in total and has 1 son.    - This implies that the brother also has a total of 5 nephews and nieces. Since Alice's father is one of those nephews\/nieces, it means that the brother has:      - 1 son (his own child) + 4 children (that belong to Alice's father's side, including Alice).  5. **Counting Alice\u2019s Cousins**:    - From Alice's mother's side, there are 6 cousins (children of her uncles).    - From Alice's father's side, her father has 2 sisters. Assume each has at least 1 child. This would contribute at least 2 more cousins (if each aunt has only one child).    - The total cousins Alice might have:      - From Mother's side: 6      - From Father's side: 2 (minimum, assuming 1 child for each sister)    So, if Alice has at least 6 cousins from her mother\u2019s side and at least 2 from her father\u2019s side, Alice has a total of at least \\( 6 + 2 = 8 \\) cousins.  Conclusively, Alice's siblings (sisters and brother) also have the same cousins. Therefore, Alice's sister also has 8 cousins.  ### Answer: 8",

However, it's noted that Alice's mother has 6 nephews and nieces in total. Since the mother has 2 brothers, the 6 nephews and nieces must consist of the children from her brothers.     - Therefore, if we denote the number of children per uncle as \\(x\\) (number of children from the first uncle) and \\(y\\) (number of children from the second uncle), we can write the equation:      \\( x + y = 6 \\).  4. **Alice's Father**:    - Alice's father has 2 sisters, making Alice's aunts.     - He also has a brother who has 5 nephews and nieces in total. This brother also has 1 son; this means that the son alone accounts for 1 of the cousins. Therefore, the rest (4) must be children from either Alice\u2019s father\u2019s sisters or his brother.  5. **Cousins from Father\u2019s Side**:    - If Alice's father has 2 sisters \\(A1\\) and \\(A2\\) and his brother has a son \\(C1\\), the total number of cousins from the father\u2019s side would include \\(C1\\) plus the children from \\(A1\\) and \\(A2\\).    - The total number of cousins can be expressed as:      \\( C_{total} = 1 (C1) + x_{A1} + x_{A2} \\).  6. **Total Cousins Calculation**:    - If we know the father\u2019s brother has a total of 5 nephews and nieces, we have:      \\( x_{A1} + x_{A2} = 5 - 1 = 4 \\) (since \\(C1\\) counts as one cousin).  Now, let\u2019s count the cousins Alice has from both sides: - From her mother (the number is collectively determined as \\(6\\)), but we conclude they are Alice's cousins. - From her father, we have \\(5\\) cousins in total (1 from her father\u2019s brother, plus 4 from the aunts).  **Calculating Total Cousins**: - Total Cousins = Cousins from Mother's Side + Cousins from Father's Side = 6 (from mother) + 5 (from father) = 11.  Now, **Cousins for Alice's Sisters**: All the cousins are counted as Alice\u2019s cousins, which means her sisters have the same cousins as she does.

The information states that Alice's mother's sister has 6 nephews and nieces but does not contribute to the cousin count since she does not have children.    - Therefore, Alice's mother's 2 brothers will contribute to the cousin count, but the specific number of their children is not known from the information we have.   3. **Alice's Father's Side**:    - Alice's father has 2 sisters.    - He also has 1 brother who has a son (so he has at least 1 nephew\/niece from Alice's father).    - Alice's father's brother has a total of 5 nephews and nieces. Considering that one of them is the son of Alice's father's brother, this means:      - The brother has children (we already know he has 1 son) and Alice's father (and his siblings) also accounts for the rest.    - Since Alice's father has 2 sisters, this means that Alice's father's sisters must also have children, contributing to the cousin count.  4. **Cousin Count Calculation**:    - We can't determine the exact number of cousins without concrete numbers from Alice's mother's brothers and Alice's father's sisters.    - But based on Alice's family structure, cousins from Alice's mother's brothers and Alice's father's sisters must be counted.  While we do not know specific numbers of cousins due to the lack of detail on how many kids Alice's mother\u2019s brothers and Alice\u2019s father\u2019s sisters have, we do know:  - From Alice's mother's side, she has at least 2 cousins from her mother's brothers. - From Alice's father's side, we know he has 2 sisters and 1 brother who also has a son.   Thus, without the exact number of children Alice has, the best way to determine the total number of Alice's cousins comes from the combination of contributions.   In summary, Alice, together with her siblings, has at least 2 (from her mother's side) + some from her father's side, leading to multiple cousins whose exact count we don't know.   So, if we summarize by their siblings: - Each of Alice's siblings has the same cousin count derived from those calculations \u2014 so Alice, and thus her sisters, will know the cousins but exact count is not ascertainable.  ### Answer: Not explicitly determinable from given data.",
