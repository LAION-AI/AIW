These nephews and nieces come from the children of the father's siblings, which include Alice and her siblings. Given the brothers and sisters of the father:        - Alice and her **1 brother** have **3 children** (assuming all nephews and nieces are from them, but the exact distribution isn't specified in the problem).        - The **2 paternal aunts** have **2 children** total (since 5 nephews and nieces minus Alice's siblings' children).  4. **Total Cousins:**    - From the **father's side**: **3 cousins** (2 from paternal aunts and 1 from paternal uncle).    - From the **mother's side**: **0 cousins** (no children mentioned).

Therefore, we need to calculate the number of children born to Alice's parents' siblings.  **Maternal Side:**  - **Alice's Mother** has:   - **2 brothers** (Alice's uncles) and **1 sister** (Alice's aunt) who has **no children**. - The aunt (who has no children) has **6 nephews and nieces**, which are the children of her siblings. - Alice's mother has **3 children** (Alice, her sister, and a brother). - Therefore, the **2 uncles** must have the remaining **3 children** (since 6 total nephews and nieces - 3 from Alice's mother = 3 from the uncles).  **Paternal Side:**  - **Alice's Father** has:   - **2 sisters** (Alice's aunts) and **1 brother** (Alice's uncle) who has **1 daughter**. - The uncle has **5 nephews and nieces**, which are the children of his siblings. - Alice's father has **3 children** (Alice, her sister, and a brother). - Therefore, the **2 aunts** must have the remaining **2 children** (since 5 total nephews and nieces - 3 from Alice's father = 2 from the aunts).  **Total Cousins:**  - **Maternal cousins**: **3** (from the uncles) - **Paternal cousins**: **1** (from the uncle) + **2** (from the aunts) = **3**  Adding them up: **3 (maternal) + 3 (paternal) = 6 cousins**  ### Answer: 6",

        "model_response":"Let's think through this step-by-step:  1. Alice has 1 sister and 1 brother. This means Alice's parents have 3 children in total.  2. Alice's mother has:    - 2 brothers    - 1 sister (who has no children)  3. Alice's father has:    - 2 sisters    - 1 brother (who has 1 daughter)  4. Now, let's count the cousins:        From mother's side:    - Mother's 2 brothers might have children, but we don't know how many.    - Mother's sister has no children.     From father's side:    - Father's 2 sisters might have children, but we don't know how many.    - Father's brother has 1 daughter (explicitly stated).  5.

These are:    - Alice    - Alice's sister    - Alice's brother    - Children of mother's 2 brothers (let's call this number x)    So: 3 + x = 6    x = 3  6.

Now we can count the cousins:    - From mother's side: 3 (children of mother's 2 brothers)    - From father's side: 2 (children of father's 2 sisters) + 1 (daughter of father's brother) = 3  8.
