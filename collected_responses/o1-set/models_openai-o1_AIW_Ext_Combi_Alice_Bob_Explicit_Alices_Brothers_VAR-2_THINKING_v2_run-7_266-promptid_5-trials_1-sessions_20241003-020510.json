        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's start by understanding the family structure based on the information given:  1. **Alice and Bob are sister and brother**, which means they are siblings in the same family. 2. **Alice has 2 sisters.** When someone says they have a certain number of sisters, it typically means they have that many sisters *in addition to themselves*. Therefore, including herself, there are **3 sisters in total**. 3. **Bob has 2 brothers.** Similarly, this means Bob has 2 brothers besides himself, so there are **3 brothers in total**.     Now, since Alice and Bob are siblings, their family consists of:  - **3 sisters** (including Alice): Alice and her 2 sisters. - **3 brothers** (including Bob): Bob and his 2 brothers.  Thus, the total number of children in the family is **6**: 3 sisters and 3 brothers.  Therefore, **Alice has 3 brothers** (Bob and his 2 brothers).  ### Answer: 3",
