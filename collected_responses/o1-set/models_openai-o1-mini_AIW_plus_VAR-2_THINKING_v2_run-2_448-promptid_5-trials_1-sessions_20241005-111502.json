        "model_response":"Let's break down the problem step by step:  1. **Alice's Immediate Family:**    - Alice has 3 sisters, making a total of 4 daughters in her immediate family.  2. **Mother's Side:**    - Mother has 1 sister (maternal aunt) who has no children.    - Mother has 2 brothers (maternal uncles).    - The maternal aunt has 6 nephews and nieces. Since she has no children, these 6 come from the mother's 2 brothers and potentially other siblings.      - Mother has 4 daughters (Alice and her 3 sisters), who are nieces\/nephews to the maternal aunt.      - Therefore, the 2 maternal uncles have a total of 2 children (since 6 total nephews\/nieces minus 4 from the mother's side equals 2).  3. **Father's Side:**    - Father has 1 brother (paternal uncle).    - This uncle has 4 nephews and nieces, which are Alice and her 3 sisters (totaling 4).    - Additionally, the uncle has 1 son.  4. **Total Cousins:**    - **From Mother's Side:** 2 cousins (children of the 2 maternal uncles).    - **From Father's Side:** 1 cousin (the uncle's son).    - **Total Cousins:** 2 (mother's side) + 1 (father's side) = **3 cousins**.  ### Answer: 3",
