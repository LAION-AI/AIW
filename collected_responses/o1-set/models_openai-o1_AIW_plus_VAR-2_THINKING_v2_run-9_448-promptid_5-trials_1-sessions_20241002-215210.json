        "model_response":"To determine how many cousins Alice's sister has, let's break down the family relationships step by step.  **Alice's Immediate Family:** - Alice has **3 sisters**, so there are **4 daughters** in total in Alice's family (including Alice).  **Maternal Side (Alice's Mother's Family):**  1. **Alice's Mother** has:    - **1 sister** who **does not have children**.    - **2 brothers**.  2. The sister (Alice's maternal aunt) has **6 nephews and nieces**.    - Since she has no children, these nephews and nieces must be the children of her siblings (Alice's mother and her two brothers).  3. **Alice's Mother** has **4 daughters** (Alice and her 3 sisters).    - Therefore, the nephews and nieces from Alice's mother are **4**.  4. The remaining nephews and nieces come from the two brothers.    - Total nephews and nieces = 6    - Nephews and nieces from Alice's mother = 4    - So, nephews and nieces from the two brothers = 6 - 4 = **2**  5. Therefore, the two brothers have **2 children** collectively.    - These are Alice's **maternal cousins**.  **Paternal Side (Alice's Father's Family):**  1. **Alice's Father** has:    - **1 brother** who has **1 son**.  2. The brother (Alice's paternal uncle) has **4 nephews and nieces**.    - These are the children of his siblings.  3. Since Alice's father's brother has only one sibling (Alice's father), and Alice's father has **4 daughters**, the nephews and nieces are:    - **4 daughters of Alice's father** (Alice and her sisters).    - Thus, the uncle's **4 nephews and nieces** are Alice and her 3 sisters.  4. The uncle's **1 son** is Alice's **paternal cousin**.  **Total Cousins for Alice's Sister:** - **Maternal cousins**: **2** (from the maternal uncles). - **Paternal cousins**: **1** (the son of the paternal uncle). - **Total cousins**: 2 (maternal) + 1 (paternal) = **3 cousins**.  ### Answer: 3",

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we'll need to carefully map out Alice's family tree and count her cousins step by step.  **1. Alice's Immediate Family:** - Alice has **3 sisters** (so there are 4 daughters in total). - There's no mention of any brothers, so we'll assume there are none.  **2. Maternal Side (Mother's Family):** - Alice's mother has:   - **1 sister** who **does not have children**.   - **2 brothers** (Uncle B and Uncle C). - The childless aunt has **6 nephews and nieces**. Since she doesn't have her own children, these are the children of her siblings (Alice's mother, Uncle B, and Uncle C).  **Calculating the nephews and nieces:** - Alice's mother has **4 children** (Alice and her 3 sisters). - This means Uncle B and Uncle C together have **2 children** (since 6 total nephews and nieces minus the 4 from Alice's mother equals 2). - Therefore, on the **maternal side**, Alice has **2 cousins** (the children of Uncle B and Uncle C).  **3. Paternal Side (Father's Family):** - Alice's father has **1 brother** who has:   - **1 son** (Alice's cousin).   - **4 nephews and nieces**. - The uncle's nephews and nieces are the children of his siblings. Since only Alice's father is mentioned, we'll assume he has no other siblings. - Alice's father's brother has **4 nephews and nieces**, which aligns with Alice and her **3 sisters**. - Therefore, on the **paternal side**, Alice has **1 cousin** (the son of her father's brother).  **4.
