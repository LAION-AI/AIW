Alice's mother also has 1 sister who doesn't have children. This aunt has 2 nephews and 4 nieces in total. Since this aunt doesn't have children, these nieces and nephews must come from her siblings (Alice's mother and her 2 brothers). We already know that Alice's mother has 3 children (Alice, Sister, and their brother), so the remaining 3 nieces and nephews (2 nephews + 4 nieces - 3 children of Alice's mother = 3) must be the children of the 2 brothers. These 3 children are cousins to Sister.  4. Alice's father has 2 sisters. We don't know if they have children, so we can't count any cousins from this side yet.  5. Alice's father also has a brother who has 3 nephews and 2 nieces in total, and who also has 1 daughter. The 1 daughter is counted among the 2 nieces.

        "model_response":"Let's think through this step-by-step:  1. We need to count Alice's cousins, which will be the same number as Alice's sister's cousins.  2. Cousins come from aunts and uncles, so we need to look at Alice's parents' siblings.  3. From Alice's mother's side:    - Her mother has 2 brothers    - Her mother has 1 sister, but this sister has no children  4. From Alice's father's side:    - Her father has 2 sisters    - Her father has 1 brother  5.

The tricky part is the information about nephews and nieces:    - Mother's sister has 2 nephews and 4 nieces (6 total)    - Father's brother has 3 nephews and 2 nieces (5 total)  7. These nephews and nieces must be Alice, her siblings, and her cousins.  8. We know Alice has 1 sister and 1 brother (3 siblings total)  9. For the mother's side:    6 (total nephews\/nieces) - 3 (Alice and her siblings) = 3 cousins  10. For the father's side:     5 (total nephews\/nieces) - 3 (Alice and her siblings) = 2 cousins  11. We also know the father's brother has 1 daughter, which is already counted in the 2 cousins from step 10.  12.

Now, let's look at the information about children:    - Alice's mother's sister has no children    - Alice's father's brother has 1 daughter  3. We need to find out how many cousins Alice's sister has. This would be the total number of children of Alice's aunts and uncles, excluding Alice and her siblings.  4. We know:    - Alice has 1 sister and 1 brother (3 children total in her immediate family)    - Alice's father's brother has 3 nephews and 2 nieces in total (5 children)    - Out of these 5 children, 3 are Alice and her siblings    - Alice's father's brother also has 1 daughter  5.

Let's examine Alice's father's side:    - Alice's father has 2 sisters    - Alice's father has 1 brother    - This brother has 3 nephews and 2 nieces (5 in total)    - These 5 must be Alice and her siblings (3) plus 2 cousins from the father's sisters    - The brother also has 1 daughter, which is another cousin  4. Counting the cousins:    - From mother's side: 6 (total nephews\/nieces) - 3 (Alice and her siblings) = 3 cousins    - From father's side: 2 (from sisters) + 1 (from brother) = 3 cousins  5. Total number of cousins:    - 3 (mother's side) + 3 (father's side) = 6 cousins  6.
