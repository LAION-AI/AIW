        "model_response":"To determine how many cousins Alice's sister has, we need to process the family relationships and count the number of cousins:  1. **Alice's Siblings**:    - Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother.    - Therefore, Alice herself (1) plus her siblings (3 others) totals 4 children in Alice's immediate family.  2. **Mother\u2019s Side**:    - Alice's mother has 2 brothers.    - These two brothers together have children that would be Alice\u2019s and her siblings\u2019 cousins.  3. **Mother\u2019s Sister**:    - Alice's mother\u2019s sister has no children but has 6 nephews and nieces in total.    - These 6 nieces and nephews must be the children of Alice\u2019s mother and her mother\u2019s two brothers.  4. **Father\u2019s Side**:    - Alice\u2019s father has 2 sisters and 1 brother.    - Alice\u2019s father\u2019s brother has 5 nephews and nieces in total.   5. **Father\u2019s Brother's Son**:    - Alice\u2019s father's brother also has one son.     Now, let\u2019s break down each relationship to identify the cousins:  ### Mother\u2019s Side - Both brothers of Alice's mother must have children since there are 6 nieces and nephews total:   - This 6 includes Alice and her siblings (4), meaning there are 2 additional cousins.   - Thus, both maternal uncles together add up to 2 cousins for Alice.  ### Father's Side - Alice's father has 2 sisters and 1 brother. - The brother has one son; since he himself has 5 nephews\/nieces, and we've identified this son as one of them:   - The 5 nephews and nieces of Alice's father's brother include Alice and her siblings (4).   - Therefore, this one additional cousin is counted.  ### Total Cousins Since each child in the two sides\u2019 count (maternal and paternal): - From maternal uncles: 2 cousins. - From paternal uncle (1 more cousin). Adding these up: 2 (maternal) + 1 (paternal) = 3 cousins.  ### Final Check Making sure we considered all relations: the other father-side siblings (2 sisters) don't contribute additional cousins directly in terms of nephews\/nieces since they weren't specified with children.   ### Answer:  Therefore, Alice's sister has a total of 3 cousins.  ### Answer: 003",

        "model_response":"Sure, let's break this down step by step to find how many cousins Alice's sister has.  First, let's establish Alice's immediate family: - Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother. This means there are 4 siblings in total (including Alice).  Next, let's look at Alice's extended family:  **Mother's Side:** - Alice's mother has 2 brothers.   - Each of these brothers could potentially have children. Let\u2019s denote them as M1 and M2.  **Father's Side:** - Alice's father has 2 sisters. Each sister could potentially have children. Let's denote them as P1 and P2. - Alice's father has a brother who has 5 nephews and nieces in total (including Alice and her siblings). Since Alice and her siblings make up 4 of these (Alice, 2 sisters, and 1 brother), this brother must have 1 other child, and this child is another cousin to Alice's sister.  Next, account for the aunt on Alice's mother's side with 6 nephews and nieces: - This number includes all of Alice's mother's siblings\u2019 children, meaning Alice's mother and her 2 brothers (M1 and M2). Since Alice\u2019s mother has 4 children (including Alice), the remaining nephews and nieces must be from her 2 brothers. - Alice\u2019s aunt who has no children has 6 nephews and nieces inclusive of Alice and Alice's siblings. So,:   - Alice and her siblings account for 4 of those.   - Therefore, the remaining 2 children must be the children of her mother's two brothers (M1 and M2).  Now, combining the detailed information: - From Mother's brothers (2 brothers):   - Each of these brothers must have 1 child each (total 2 children).  **Summary on Cousins Count:** - On the mother's side: 2 cousins (from M1 and M2). - On the father's side: 1 cousin (father's brother's child).  So, adding up all the cousins Alice's sister has: - From mother\u2019s side: 2 cousins. - From father\u2019s side: 1 cousin. - Total: 2 + 1 = 3 cousins.  ### Answer: 3",

        "model_response":"Let's analyze the information step by step:  1. **Alice's immediate family:**     - Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother.     - Therefore, there are 4 children in Alice's family: Alice, her 2 sisters, and her brother.  2. **Alice's maternal side:**     - Alice's mother has 2 brothers.     - Alice\u2019s mother has 1 sister who has no children.     - This sister (Alice's aunt on her mother's side) has 6 nephews and nieces. Since this aunt has no children, these 6 nephews and nieces must be the children of Alice\u2019s mother and her 2 brothers.          Let's break it down:     - The 6 nephews and nieces are the combination of Alice, her siblings, and Alice's cousins from her mother's 2 brothers.      **Assuming x and y are the number of children that Alice's maternal uncles have:**     - Alice, her 2 sisters, and her brother count as 4 children.     - The equation is: \\(4 + x + y = 6\\).     - Therefore, \\(x + y = 2\\).           Alice's maternal uncles together have 2 children in total.  3. **Alice's paternal side:**     - Alice's father has 2 sisters.     - Alice\u2019s father has 1 brother who has 5 nephews and nieces in total, and 1 son.          Let's break it down:     - The 5 nephews and nieces are Alice, her sisters, and her brother (4 in total) plus 1 additional nephew or niece coming from Alice's father's brother.          Therefore, Alice\u2019s father\u2019s brother has 1 child.  4. **Calculating Alice\u2019s cousins:**      - From the maternal side: 2 children from her mother's brothers.     - From the paternal side: 1 child from her father\u2019s brother.      Adding these together: \\(2\\) (maternal side) \\(+ 1\\) (paternal side) = 3 cousins.  Thus, Alice's sisters have 3 cousins.  ### Answer: 3",

        "model_response":"To determine how many cousins Alice's sister has, let's analyze the family structure step-by-step.  ### Alice's Immediate Family: - Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother. This means there are 4 siblings total (including Alice).  ### Mother's Side: - Alice's mother has 2 brothers. - Alice's mother's sister has no children but has 6 nephews and nieces in total. Since these nieces and nephews cannot come from her, they must come from Alice's mother and her mother's 2 brothers.   - Alice's mother's sister has 6 nieces and nephews in total, 4 of whom are Alice and her siblings.   That leaves us with 2 more nieces\/nephews, which must belong to Alice's mother's brothers. Therefore: - One of Alice's maternal uncles must have 2 children.  ### Father's Side: - Alice's father has 2 sisters and 1 brother.   - Alice's father's brother has 5 nephews and nieces in total. Alice and her siblings count as 4 of these, so there must be 1 other niece\/nephew. Additionally, he has 1 son.   - 5 nephews and nieces, including Alice's 4 siblings, leave 1 other niece\/nephew, and he has an additional son. This means the paternal uncle has 1 son, and Alice and her siblings are his 5 nephews\/nieces.  ### Cousin Count: 1. On the maternal side:    - One of Alice's maternal uncles has 2 children.  2. On the paternal side:    - One paternal uncle has 1 son.  Thus, Alice's sister has 2 (from a maternal uncle) + 1 (from a paternal uncle) = 3 cousins.  ### Answer: ### Answer: 3",

        "model_response":"To find out how many cousins Alice's sister has, we will analyze the family relationships step by step.  ### Alice's Family: - Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother. This means Alice has a total of **3 siblings**. - Alice's mother has **2 brothers** (which makes Alice have a total of **2 uncles on her mother's side**). - Alice's mother also has **1 sister** who does not have children, thus she has no nephews or nieces.    Now, we know from the problem stated that Alice's mother's sister has **6 nephews and nieces** in total. Since Alice has a brother and 2 sisters, this means the 6 nephews and nieces must come from Alice's mother's brothers (her uncles), since her sister has no kids.   Since each of Alice's mother\u2019s 2 brothers must have had children, the children from both uncles must add up to the total of 6. Therefore: - Let\u2019s denote the number of children from Alice\u2019s uncles as \\( x \\) (children from uncle 1) and \\( y \\) (children from uncle 2). - \\( x + y = 6 \\), this means the total number of cousins on Alice's mother side is **6 cousins** across her uncles.  ### Alice's Father's Family: - Alice's father has **2 sisters** (which makes Alice have a total of **2 aunts on her father's side**), - He has a brother who has **5 nephews and nieces** in total and **1 son** (which means he has 4 children).  Now we can summarize Alice's cousins: - From her mother's side, she has **6 cousins**. - From her father's side, she has **5 cousins** (the children of her father\u2019s brother). - Her father\u2019s sisters could also have children, but we are not informed about how many children they each have, meaning that the total number of cousins from the father's sisters is unknown.  ### Counting Alice\u2019s Cousins: So, Alice\u2019s sister's total cousins from her mother is 6. From her father, she has both some cousins from her father\u2019s brother, and potentially cousins from her father\u2019s sisters, which could add more but are unknown.  To finalize: - The information given indicates no children from Alice's father\u2019s sisters or if there are any, it remains unspecified, hence we will only count what is certain.  Finally: - **Total certain cousins: 6 (from the mother) + 5 (from the father's brother)** = 11 total cousins.  However, to find the number of cousins specifically for Alice's sister, I consider that each of Alice's siblings shares the same cousins: - Hence Alice's sister still would also be related to the same **11 cousins**.  Thus, Alice's sister would have **11 cousins** overall.  ### Answer: 11",

        "model_response":"Let's break down the family relationships step by step to determine how many cousins Alice's sister has.  1. **Alice's Immediate Family:**    - Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother. Therefore, Alice\u2019s siblings are:       - Sisters: 2      - Brother: 1    - Total children of Alice's parents = 4 (Alice + 2 sisters + 1 brother).  2. **Alice's Mother's Side:**    - Alice's mother has 2 brothers. Therefore, she has 2 uncles.    - The mother has 1 sister (as stated) who does not have children.    - This sister has 6 nephews and nieces in total. Since we know that Alice's mother has herself (1 daughter) and 3 children (2 sisters + Alice), these are the 6 nephews and nieces from Alice's mother's side.    - Alice's mother's nephews\/nieces = 3 sisters (Alice + 2) + 1 brother = 4 children.     Since the sister has no children, they must all be the children of Alice's uncles. The uncles must have a total of 4 children between them, meaning they collectively have 4 children.  3. **Alice's Father\u2019s Side:**    - Alice's father has 2 sisters, which are Alice\u2019s aunts.    - He has 1 brother who has 5 nephews and nieces in total.    - Considering Alice's family again, Alice's father's brother\u2019s children will count Alice's siblings as his nephews and nieces (4 children total).    - Hence, Alice\u2019s father\u2019s brother must indeed have 1 son and 4 (from his brother) = 5 total.  From here, we can summarize:  - Alice has:   - 2 aunts from her father\u2019s side who may have children, but we don't know how many (they are not specified).   - 2 uncles (from her mother\u2019s side) who have collectively 4 children (cousins).  4. **Counting Alice's Cousins:**    - From her mother's side, Alice has 4 cousins (children of her mother's brothers).    - From her father's side, Alice's cousins are unknown from her aunts but at least they have their own children, adding potentially more cousins.  So now we need to consider how many cousins Alice\u2019s sister has: - **Cousins from mother's side:** 4 - **Cousins from father's side:** - Since we don't know the total number of children of her aunts, they can range from 0 to however many they may have but can confidently assume at least a few.    To find her exact total without speculative numbers: - If we assume each aunt has at least 0 children, the total would only be 4 cousins from the mother's side.  - However, we can assume there are some from her aunts as well. We keep the minimum consideration.  Thus, Alice's sister can confidently count 4 cousins plus potentially some more from her father's side.  ### Final Answer: So let's state simply, at minimum, Alice's sister has 4 cousins, acknowledging that the true total may be slightly higher but cannot be less than 4.  ### Answer: 4",

This means Alice's mother has a total of 2 uncles from her mother's side.      - Alice's mother has 1 sister (Aunt) who does not have children. This aunt does not contribute to Alice's cousins.      - Alice's mother\u2019s brothers (uncles) may or may not have children, but we have no information about them so far.     2. **Counting Nephews and Nieces**:    - Alice's mother\u2019s sister has 6 nephews and nieces in total.      - Since Alice is one of them, we take her mother's total nephews\/nieces (which includes Alice and her siblings) and find:        - Alice\u2019s mother has Alice (1), her 2 sisters (2), and her 1 brother (1):           - So, Alice's mother has a total of 4 children (herself + siblings = Alice's family).        - This leaves the other 2 nephews\/nieces coming from her mother's brothers.     3. **Alice's Father's Family**:    - Alice's father has 2 sisters (Aunts) who may have children.    - He has 1 brother who has 5 nephews and nieces in total.       - Since Alice's father contributes Alice and her siblings (which counts as 4),      - Thus, the brother must have 1 additional nephew\/niece (as Alice\u2019s father + siblings = 5).  4. **Alice's Cousins**:    - From the mother's side:      - We primarily consider only the uncles (the 2 brothers of Alice's mother), as the sister has no children.      - The details about the uncles\u2019 children are unknown, but they could potentially have children which we can assume but have no count.    - From the father's side:      - He has 2 sisters (each potentially having children) and a brother who has additional siblings\u2019 children.  5. **Final Count**: - Assuming that Alice's mother\u2019s brothers and Alice's father\u2019s sisters have children:   - From her mother\u2019s side, the total number of cousins from the 2 uncles (again assuming an even spread) could be guessed at 2 cousins (maximum estimation can be overlooked as this may also mean 0).   - From her father\u2019s side, let's infer a reasonable approach (like 2 siblings plus Alice's father contributing), lets say 4 cousins maximum estimated from this side.  By tallying extreme possible estimates for Alice's cousins:  Assumed maximum cousins count could be:   Total Cousins = 2 (from mother side) + 4 (from father side) = 6 possible cousins.  Lastly, looking back to the question, Alice's sister (1 of the siblings) shares equally within the total cousins. Thus, Alice's sister has the same amount as Alice.  ### Answer: 6",

        "model_response":"Let's break down the information step by step:  1. **Alice's Immediate Family:**    - Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother.    - Therefore, Alice has a total of 3 siblings.  2. **Alice's Mother:**    - Alice's mother has 2 brothers.    - Therefore, Alice's maternal uncles (her mother's brothers) count as 2.  3. **Alice's Mother's Sister:**    - Alice's mother has 1 sister (Alice's aunt).    - This aunt does not have children.  4. **Alice's Mother's Siblings' Children:**    - Alice's mother's siblings (2 brothers + 1 sister = 3 siblings) collectively contribute to Alice's cousins.    - Since her aunt does not have children, only her 2 uncles can contribute.    - Alice has no direct information about how many children these 2 uncles have.  5. **Total Nephews and Nieces from Alice's Mother's Side:**    - The statement mentions Alice's mother has 6 nephews and nieces in total.    - Since Alice and her siblings are included, the total number of Alice's cousins from her mother's side must make up the rest:    - Alice has 3 siblings, so there are 4 children in total (Alice plus 3 siblings).    - Therefore, the cousins from her mother's side must be 6 (total nephews and nieces) - 4 (Alice and her siblings) = 2 cousins from her mother's side.  6. **Alice's Father:**    - Alice's father has 2 sisters.    - Therefore, Alice's paternal aunts count as 2.  7. **Alice's Father's Brother:**    - Alice's father has 1 brother.    - This brother has 5 nephews and nieces in total.    - As before, this includes Alice and her siblings.  8. **Total Nephews and Nieces from Alice's Father's Side:**    - Alice and her 3 siblings account for 4 children.    - Therefore, from her father's brother who has 5 in total, we can calculate the cousins:    - Total cousins = 5 (top) - 4 (Alice's siblings) = 1 cousin from her father's side.  9. **Calculating Total Cousins:**    - From Alice's mother's side, she has 2 cousins.    - From Alice's father's side, she has 1 cousin.    - Total cousins = 2 + 1 = 3.  Now, since the question asks how many cousins Alice\u2019s sister has, the number of cousins remains the same (they share the same cousins).  ### Answer: 3",

        "model_response":"To determine how many cousins Alice's sister has, let's break down the given information step-by-step.  **1. Alice's Siblings:** - Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother. This means she has a total of 3 siblings (2 sisters + 1 brother).  **2. Alice's Mother's Family:** - Alice's mother has 2 brothers.      - Let's denote her brothers as Uncle 1 and Uncle 2.     - It is stated that Alice's mother has a sister who does not have children.  **3. Alice's Mother's Sister's Children:** - Since the sister of Alice's mother does not have children, we focus only on the 2 brothers. - If each brother (Uncle 1 and Uncle 2) has children, the term \"6 nephews and nieces in total\" refers to the children of these 2 brothers. Let's denote the children of Uncle 1 as A (x) and Uncle 2 as B (y).     - Since they have a total of 6 children, they could either divide this (e.g., Uncle 1 could have 3 kids and Uncle 2 could have 3 kids) or any other distribution as long as the total is 6.  **4. Alice's Father's Family:** - Alice's father has 2 sisters.      - Denote them as Aunt 1 and Aunt 2. - He also has a brother who has a total of 5 nephews and nieces.     - This brother's children make up the nephews and nieces of Alice.   **5. Who Are Alice's Cousins?** - Cousins of Alice are the children of her parents' siblings (the aunts and uncles). - From Alice's mother, her cousins are the children of Uncle 1 and Uncle 2 (total of 6). - From Alice's father, her cousins are the total children of Aunt 1 and Aunt 2, and the brother of Alice's father (who has 5 children).  **Putting It All Together:** - From Alice's mother's side, she has 6 cousins. - Alice's father's brother has 5 kids, who are also Alice's cousins.  Now we need to calculate how many cousins Alice's sister has: 1. Alice has 6 cousins from her mother's side. 2. Alice also has 5 cousins from her father's side.  Thus, the total number of cousins that Alice\u2019s sister has is: **Total Cousins = 6 (from mother's side) + 5 (from father's side) = 11 Cousins.**  Final Answer: ### Answer: 11",
