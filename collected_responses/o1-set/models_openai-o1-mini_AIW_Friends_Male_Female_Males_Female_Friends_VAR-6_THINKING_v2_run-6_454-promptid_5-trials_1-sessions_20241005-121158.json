        "model_response":"To determine how many female friends a male friend of Alice has, let's break down the information step by step:  1. **Alice's Friends:**    - **Female Friends:** Alice has 5 female friends.    - **Male Friends:** Alice has 3 male friends.  2. **Friendship Among Friends:**    - All of Alice's friends (both female and male) are friends with each other.    - They do not have any friends outside of this group.  3. **Analyzing a Male Friend's Connections:**    - Consider one of the male friends, say **M1**.    - **M1's Friends:**      - **Alice:** Since M1 is a friend of Alice, and assuming Alice is female, Alice counts as one female friend.      - **Other Female Friends:** M1 is also friends with Alice's 5 female friends.      - **Other Male Friends:** M1 is friends with the other 2 male friends (but these are not female).  4. **Total Female Friends for M1:**    - **Alice:** 1    - **Other Female Friends:** 5    - **Total:** 1 + 5 = **6**  ### Answer: 6",
