        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's carefully analyze the information:  1. **Alice has 4 male friends and 1 female friend.** 2. **They all are friends with each other and have no other friends aside.**  From the phrase \"They all are friends with each other,\" it implies that the group includes Alice and her 5 friends (totaling 6 people). This group forms a complete network where everyone is friends with everyone else in the group, and they have no friends outside this group.  Now, focusing on any one of Alice's male friends:  - **Friends he has within the group:**   - **Alice (female)**   - **The other 3 male friends**   - **The female friend of Alice**  - **Total friends:** 5 - **Number of female friends:** *Alice* and the *other female friend*, which makes **2 female friends**.  ### Answer: 2",
