Since she has no children, these nephews and nieces are her siblings' children.   - Alice's mother has **5 daughters** (Alice and her sisters).   - Therefore, the **6th niece\/nephew** must be the child of one of the two uncles.   - This means the uncles have a **total of 1 child** between them.  - **Maternal Cousins:** Alice and her sisters have **1 cousin** on their mother's side.  **Paternal Side (Father's Family):** - Alice's father has:   - **1 brother** (Alice's uncle) who has **1 son**.   - This uncle has **5 nephews and nieces**.     - These are Alice and her 4 sisters.  - **Paternal Cousins:** Alice and her sisters have **1 cousin** on their father's side.  **Total Cousins:** - **Maternal Cousin(s):** 1 - **Paternal Cousin(s):** 1 - **Total Cousins:** 1 + 1 = **2**  ### Answer: 2",

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's reconstruct the family tree step by step:  1. **Alice's Immediate Family**:    - Alice has **4 sisters**, making it **5 siblings** in total (Alice plus her 4 sisters).  2. **Maternal Side**:    - Alice's mother has:      - **1 sister** who **does not have children**.      - **2 brothers**.    - The childless sister has **6 nephews and nieces**. Since she is childless, these are the children of her siblings (Alice's mother and her two brothers).    - Alice's mother has **5 children** (Alice and her sisters), so the **2 brothers together have 1 child** (since 5 + 1 = 6 nephews and nieces).    - Therefore, on her mother's side, Alice's sisters have **1 cousin** (the child of the mother's brothers).  3. **Paternal Side**:    - Alice's father has a **brother** who has:      - **5 nephews and nieces**, which are Alice and her 4 sisters.      - **1 son** (Alice's cousin).    - There are no mentions of other siblings, so on the father's side, Alice's sisters have **1 cousin**.  4. **Total Cousins**:    - **Maternal Cousins**: 1    - **Paternal Cousins**: 1    - **Total**: **1 + 1 = 2 cousins**  Wait, the calculation above doesn't match the initial conclusion in the solution reasoning. There seems to be an inconsistency.  In the earlier reasoning, we concluded Alice's sisters have **6 cousins on their mother's side** (because the two brothers have **6 children**), and **1 cousin on their father's side**, making a total of **7 cousins**.  Upon re-examination:  - **Maternal Side Correction**:    - The childless aunt has **6 nephews and nieces**, which are the children of her siblings.    - Since Alice's mother has **5 children**, the **2 brothers must have 1 child** (because 5 + 1 = 6).    - So, on the mother's side, Alice's sisters have **1 cousin**.  - **Paternal Side**:    - Alice's father has a brother with **5 nephews and nieces** (Alice and her sisters), and **1 son**.    - So, on the father's side, Alice's sisters have **1 cousin**.  **Final Answer**: Alice's sister has **2 cousins**.  ### Answer: 2",
