From Alice's father's side:    - Alice's father has 2 sisters    - Alice's father has 1 brother    - This brother has 5 nephews and nieces in total    - This brother has 1 daughter  4.

Double-checking:    - We only have confirmed information about 1 cousin (the daughter of Alice's father's brother)    - We don't have enough information to determine if there are any other cousins  6. Important note:    - The question asks about Alice's sister's cousins, not Alice's cousins    - However, Alice and her sister would have the same cousins  Therefore, based on the given information, we can only confirm one cousin.  ### Answer: 1",

Now, let's look at the children of these aunts and uncles:    - Mother's sister: No children    - Father's brother: 1 daughter    - We don't have information about the children of the other aunts and uncles  3. We know that Alice's father's brother has 5 nephews and nieces in total:    - Alice and her siblings are 4 of these (Alice, her sister, and 3 brothers)    - The remaining 1 must be from the father's sisters  4. We know that Alice's mother's sister has 6 nephews and nieces:    - These are Alice and her siblings (4 in total)    - The remaining 2 must be from the mother's brothers  5.

Now, let's look at Alice's mother's side:    - Alice's mother has 2 brothers    - Alice's mother has 1 sister (who has no children)  3. On Alice's father's side:    - Alice's father has 2 sisters    - Alice's father has 1 brother (who has 1 daughter)  4. To find Alice's sister's cousins, we need to count the children of Alice's aunts and uncles:     From mother's side:    - 2 uncles: We don't know how many children they have     From father's side:    - 2 aunts: We don't know how many children they have    - 1 uncle: We know he has 1 daughter  5. We're given some information about nephews and nieces:    - Alice's mother's sister has 6 nephews and nieces    - Alice's father's brother has 5 nephews and nieces  6. Let's analyze the nephews and nieces:    - Alice and her 4 siblings (1 sister + 3 brothers) account for 5 of the 6 nephews and nieces mentioned for the mother's sister    - Alice and her 4 siblings account for all 5 of the nephews and nieces mentioned for the father's brother  7. This means:    - There is 1 more cousin from the mother's side (6 - 5 = 1)    - There are no additional cousins from the father's side besides the 1 daughter we already know about  8. Therefore, Alice's sister's cousins are:    - 1 from mother's side    - 1 from father's side (the daughter of Alice's father's brother)  9. Total number of cousins: 1 + 1 = 2  ### Answer: 2",

Step 1: Determine the number of cousins from Alice's mother's side. - Alice's mother's brothers' children are Alice's first cousins. - The number of these cousins is not explicitly given, so we cannot determine the exact number.

Step 3: Analyze the given information about Alice's mother's sister. - Alice's mother's sister does not have children, so she does not contribute to the number of Alice's cousins. - The 6 nephews and nieces mentioned are likely Alice, her sister, and her 3 brothers, along with one more child (possibly from Alice's father's brother).  Step 4: Determine the total number of cousins for Alice's sister. - Alice's sister has the same number of cousins as Alice. - However, due to the lack of explicit information about the number of children Alice's mother's brothers and father's sisters have, we cannot determine the exact number of cousins.
