Since Alice and her 3 sisters are 4 in number, the additional nephew\/niece likely comes from another sibling (possibly from another side not detailed here).    - **Cousins from Paternal Side:**       - At least **1** cousin from the paternal uncle's son.  4. **Total Cousins:**    - **Maternal Cousins:** 6    - **Paternal Cousins:** At least 1    - **Total:** **6 + 1 = 7 cousins**  ### Answer: 7",
