        "model_response":"Let's think through this step by step:  1. First, let's identify Alice's aunts and uncles:    - From her mother's side: 2 uncles and 1 aunt    - From her father's side: 2 aunts and 1 uncle    Total: 6 aunts and uncles  2. Now, let's count the children of these aunts and uncles:    - Mother's sister: 0 children (mentioned explicitly)    - Mother's 2 brothers: Not specified    - Father's 2 sisters: Not specified    - Father's brother: 2 sons (mentioned explicitly)  3. We're told that Alice's father's brother has 5 nephews and nieces in total. This includes:    - Alice    - Alice's sister    - Alice's brother    So, this uncle must have 2 other nephews\/nieces from Alice's father's sisters.  4. We're also told that Alice's mother's sister has 6 nephews and nieces in total. This includes:    - Alice    - Alice's sister    - Alice's brother    - 2 children from Alice's father's brother    So, Alice's mother's brothers must have 1 child in total.  5. Summing up the cousins:    - From mother's side: 1 (from mother's brothers)    - From father's side: 2 (from father's brother) + 2 (from father's sisters) = 4  6. Total number of cousins: 1 + 4 = 5  7. Double-checking: This matches with the information given about the uncles' nephews and nieces.  Therefore, Alice's sister has 5 cousins.  ### Answer: 5",

First, let's identify Alice's aunts and uncles:    - From her mother's side: 2 uncles and 1 aunt    - From her father's side: 2 aunts and 1 uncle    Total: 6 aunts and uncles  2.

This includes:    - Alice    - Alice's sister    - Alice's brother    - 3 other nephews\/nieces (to make up the total of 6)  5. Combining the information from steps 3 and 4, we can conclude that there are 3 cousins from Alice's father's side (2 from her uncle, 1 other) and 3 cousins from Alice's mother's side.  6. Therefore, the total number of cousins is 3 + 3 = 6.
