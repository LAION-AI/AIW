These nephews and nieces come from Alice's mother's brothers.    - Therefore, the **2 maternal uncles** have a total of **6 children** (cousins).  3. **Paternal Uncles and Aunts:**    - Alice's father has **2 sisters** (paternal aunts) and **1 brother** (paternal uncle).    - The **paternal uncle** has **4 nephews and nieces** and **1 son**. The 4 nephews and nieces are Alice and her siblings' children.    - This means Alice's siblings collectively have **4 children** (cousins).  4. **Total Cousins:**    - From the maternal side: **6 cousins**.    - From the paternal side: **4 cousins**.    - **Total cousins = 6 (maternal) + 4 (paternal) = 10 cousins**.  ### Answer: 10",

        "model_response":"To determine how many cousins Alice's sister has, let's break down the information step by step:  1. **Alice's Siblings:**    - Alice has **2 sisters** and **1 brother**, making a total of **4 siblings** including herself.  2. **Children of Alice's Siblings:**    - One of her sisters does **not** have children.    - The remaining siblings (Alice, the other sister, and the brother) have a total of **6 nephews and nieces**. This means Alice's siblings have **6 children** in total.  3. **Cousins from Parents' Siblings:**    - **Maternal Side:**      - Alice's mother has **2 brothers** (maternal uncles). The number of children they have is not specified.    - **Paternal Side:**      - Alice's father has **2 sisters** (paternal aunts) and **1 brother** (paternal uncle).      - The paternal uncle has **1 son**, who would be Alice's cousin.  Since the problem specifies that Alice's sister has **6 nephews and nieces**, these are the children of Alice's siblings. Additionally, her father\u2019s brother has **1 son**, which adds one more cousin.  Therefore, **Alice's sister has a total of 7 cousins**.  ### Answer: 7",

        "model_response":"Let's approach this step by step:  1. First, let's identify Alice's immediate family:    - Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother    - This means Alice's parents have 4 children in total  2. Now, let's look at Alice's mother's side:    - Alice's mother has 2 brothers    - Alice's mother has 1 sister with no children    - The sister has 6 nephews and nieces in total  3. Alice's father's side:    - Alice's father has 2 sisters    - Alice's father has 1 brother    - This brother has 4 nephews and nieces and 1 son  4. To find Alice's cousins, we need to count the children of Alice's aunts and uncles:    - Mother's side:      * 2 uncles: We don't know how many children they have      * 1 aunt: No children    - Father's side:      * 2 aunts: We don't know how many children they have      * 1 uncle: We know he has 1 son  5. The key information is that Alice's father's brother has 4 nephews and nieces in total:    - We know 4 of these are Alice and her siblings    - This means Alice's father's brother doesn't have any other nieces or nephews    - Therefore, Alice's father's sisters (2 aunts) don't have any children  6. So, the only cousin we can confirm is the 1 son of Alice's father's brother  7. Double-checking:    - We can't determine if Alice's mother's brothers have any children    - We know Alice's mother's sister and father's sisters don't have children    - We know Alice's father's brother has 1 son  Therefore, the number of cousins we can confirm is 1.  ### Answer: 1",

        "model_response":"Let's approach this step-by-step:  1. First, let's identify Alice's siblings:    - 2 sisters    - 1 brother    So Alice has 3 siblings in total.  2. Let's look at Alice's mother's side:    - Mother has 2 brothers    - Mother has 1 sister (who has no children)    The sister has 6 nephews and nieces in total.  3. Now, Alice's father's side:    - Father has 2 sisters    - Father has 1 brother    The brother has 4 nephews and nieces in total, and 1 son.  4. To find Alice's cousins, we need to count the children of her aunts and uncles:    - Mother's side: 2 uncles, but we don't know how many children they have.    - Father's side: 2 aunts (unknown number of children) and 1 uncle with 1 son.  5. We know that Alice's father's brother has 4 nephews and nieces in total. This includes:    - Alice and her 3 siblings (4 in total)    So, this uncle doesn't have any other children besides the 1 son mentioned.  6. On the mother's side, we know her sister (Alice's aunt) has 6 nephews and nieces. This includes:    - Alice and her 3 siblings (4 in total)    - The 1 son of father's brother    - 1 more cousin  7. So from the information given, we can deduce:    - 1 cousin from mother's side    - 1 cousin from father's side (the son of father's brother)  8. Therefore, Alice has 2 cousins in total.  9. The question asks about Alice's sister's cousins. Since Alice and her sister share the same parents, they have the same cousins.  Double-checking this reasoning, it appears to be consistent with the given information.  ### Answer: 2",

Alice's immediate family:    - Alice    - 2 sisters of Alice    - 1 brother of Alice    Total: 4 children in Alice's immediate family  2. Alice's mother's side:    - Mother has 2 brothers    - Mother has 1 sister (without children)    The sister has 6 nephews\/nieces in total, which matches the 4 children in Alice's family plus 2 more.    This suggests that one of the mother's brothers has 2 children.  3. Alice's father's side:    - Father has 2 sisters    - Father has 1 brother    The brother has 4 nephews\/nieces (which are the 4 children in Alice's family) and 1 son of his own.  Now, let's count the cousins:  1. From mother's side:    - 2 cousins from one uncle    - 0 cousins from the aunt without children  2. From father's side:    - 1 cousin from the uncle    - We don't know if the 2 aunts have children, so we can't count any from them  Total cousins: 2 + 0 + 1 = 3  Double-checking: - We've accounted for all mentioned relatives - We've only counted children of Alice's aunts and uncles, not including Alice and her siblings - We've not made assumptions about unmentioned potential cousins  Therefore, Alice's sister has 3 cousins.  ### Answer: 3",
