        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the family relationships and calculate the number of cousins Alice's sister has.  1. **Alice's Immediate Family:**    - Alice has **3 sisters**, which means there are **4 daughters** in total.    - We've inferred that Alice also has a **brother** because Alice's father's brother has **5 nephews and nieces**, suggesting Alice's parents have **5 children** (since Uncle has only one sibling\u2014Alice's father).  2. **Maternal Side:**    - Alice's mother has:      - **1 sister** (who has no children).      - **2 brothers**.    - The sister with no children has **7 nephews and nieces**. These are the children of Alice's mother and her two brothers.    - Since Alice's mother has **5 children** (Alice, her 3 sisters, and 1 brother), the two brothers must have **2 children** in total (because 5 + 2 = 7).    - Therefore, Alice's sister has **2 cousins** on her mother's side (the children of her uncles).  3. **Paternal Side:**    - Alice's father has a brother (Uncle) who has:      - **1 son** (Alice's cousin).      - **5 nephews and nieces**, who are Alice and her **4 siblings**.    - There is no mention of additional siblings on the father's side, so we assume Alice's father has only one brother.    - Therefore, Alice's sister has **1 cousin** on her father's side (the uncle's son).  4. **Total Cousins:**    - **Cousins on mother's side:** 2    - **Cousin on father's side:** 1    - **Total cousins:** 2 + 1 = **3**  ### Answer: 3",
