        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we'll break it down step by step:  **Alice's Family:** - Alice has **3 sisters**, so there are **4 daughters** in total in Alice's immediate family.  **Maternal Side:** - Alice's mother has:   - **1 sister** (who has no children).   - **2 brothers** (Alice's uncles). - The childless aunt has **6 nephews and nieces**. These are the children of her siblings. - Since Alice's mother and her two brothers are the siblings, the **6 nephews and nieces** come from them. - Alice's mother has **4 daughters** (Alice and her sisters). - Therefore, the two uncles must have the remaining **2 children** (since 6 total nephews and nieces minus 4 from Alice's mother equals 2). - So, Alice has **2 maternal cousins** from her uncles.  **Paternal Side:** - Alice's father has **1 brother** who:   - Has **4 nephews and nieces**.   - Has **1 son** (Alice's cousin). - The **4 nephews and nieces** are the children of his siblings. - Assuming Alice's father has no other siblings, these nephews and nieces are Alice and her sisters. - So, Alice has **1 paternal cousin** from her uncle.  **Total Cousins:** - **Maternal Cousins:** 2 - **Paternal Cousin:** 1 - **Total Cousins:** 2 + 1 = **3**  ### Answer: 3",
