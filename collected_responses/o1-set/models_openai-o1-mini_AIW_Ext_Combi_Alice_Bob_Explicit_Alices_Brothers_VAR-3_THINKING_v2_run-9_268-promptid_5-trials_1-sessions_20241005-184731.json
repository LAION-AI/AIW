Since Alice herself is a sister, this means there are a total of **2 sisters** (Alice and her sister).  3. **Bob's Siblings:**    - Bob has **4 brothers**. Including Bob himself, this means there are a total of **5 brothers**.  4. **Determining Alice's Brothers:**    - Since Alice and Bob share the same parents, the number of brothers Alice has is the same as the total number of brothers Bob has.    - Therefore, **Alice has 5 brothers**.  ### Answer: 5",
