        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we'll need to carefully map out Alice's family tree based on the information provided.  1. **Alice's Immediate Family**:    - Alice has **2 sisters**.    - However, the problem doesn't state that these are her only siblings. Given the other information, it's implied that Alice has more siblings.  2. **Maternal Side**:    - Alice's mother has **1 sister** (who is childless) and **2 brothers**.    - The childless sister has **6 nephews and nieces**. These are the children of her siblings (Alice's mother and her two brothers).    - Therefore, the total number of children between Alice's mother and her two brothers is **6**.    - Since Alice's parents have **5 children** (as we'll establish in the next point), Alice's mother contributes **5 children** to this total.    - This means the two maternal uncles have **1 child** between them.  3. **Paternal Side**:    - Alice's father has a brother who has **2 daughters**.    - This brother has **5 nephews and nieces**. These are the children of his siblings.    - Assuming Alice's father is the only sibling (since no others are mentioned), he must have **5 children**.    - Therefore, Alice's parents have **5 children** (Alice, her 2 sisters, and 2 other siblings).  4. **Calculating Cousins**:    - **Maternal Cousins**: The two maternal uncles have **1 child** between them.    - **Paternal Cousins**: Alice's father's brother has **2 daughters**.    - **Total Cousins**: \\(1 \\text{ (maternal)} + 2 \\text{ (paternal)} = 3\\).  ### Answer: 3",

These are the children of her other siblings (Alice's mother and her two brothers). - Alice's mother has **3 daughters** (Alice and her 2 sisters). - Therefore, the two brothers must have **3 children** total (since 6 nephews and nieces minus the 3 daughters leaves 3). - Alice has **3 cousins** from her maternal uncles.  **On Alice's Father's Side:** - Alice's father has:   - One brother who has **2 daughters**.   - This brother has **5 nephews and nieces**. These are the children of his siblings. - Alice's father has **3 daughters** (Alice and her 2 sisters). - The brother's nephews and nieces from Alice's father account for **3** of the **5**. - This means there must be at least one more sibling (let's call this person Sibling X) who has **2 children** (since 5 nephews and nieces minus the 3 daughters leaves 2). - Alice has **2 cousins** from Sibling X and **2 cousins** from her father's brother.

        "model_response":"First, let's carefully reconstruct Alice's family tree to determine the number of cousins her sister has.  **Alice's Family:** - Alice has **2 sisters**. So, there are **3 siblings** in Alice's immediate family (Alice and her 2 sisters). - No mention of brothers for Alice, so we assume there are none unless specified otherwise.  **Maternal Side (Alice's Mother's Family):** - Alice's mother has:   - **1 sister** (Alice's aunt) who **does not have children**.   - **2 brothers** (Alice's maternal uncles).  - The childless aunt has **6 nephews and nieces**. Since she has no children, these are her siblings' children.   - Alice's mother and her 2 brothers are the siblings.   - Alice's mother has **3 daughters** (Alice and her sisters).   - Therefore, the **2 brothers** must have **3 children** collectively, as \\(3 (mother's children) + 3 (brothers' children) = 6 (aunt's nephews and nieces)\\).  - So, on the maternal side, Alice's sisters have **3 cousins** (the children of their mother's brothers).  **Paternal Side (Alice's Father's Family):** - Alice's father has:   - **1 brother** (Alice's uncle) who has **2 daughters**.   - This uncle has **5 nephews and nieces**. These are his brother's (Alice's father's) children.   - Since the uncle has **5 nephews and nieces**, Alice's father must have **5 children**.   - We know Alice has **2 sisters**, so there must be **2 more siblings** (making a total of 5). These could be brothers or sisters, but they are not specified.    - So, on the paternal side, Alice's sisters have **2 cousins** (the daughters of their father's brother).  **Total Cousins:** - **Maternal cousins:** 3 - **Paternal cousins:** 2 - **Total cousins:** \\(3 + 2 = 5\\)  ### Answer: 5",
