Since she has no children, these are the children of her siblings.      - Alice's mother has **4 children** (Alice and her 3 sisters).      - Therefore, the **2 brothers together have 2 children** (since 6 total nephews and nieces - 4 from Alice's mother = 2 from the brothers).     - **Maternal Cousins**:      - These are the children of Alice's maternal uncles.      - Total **maternal cousins = 2**.  3. **Paternal Side**:    - **Father's Siblings**:      - **1 brother** (Alice's paternal uncle) who has **1 son**.     - **Nephews and Nieces of the Paternal Uncle**:      - The uncle has **4 nephews and nieces**.

Since she has no children, these 6 are the combined children of her siblings.    - **Calculating Nieces and Nephews on Mother's Side**:      - The 6 nephews and nieces are from Alice's mother and her two brothers.      - Alice's mother has 4 children (Alice and her sisters).      - Therefore, the two brothers together have \\(6 - 4 = 2\\) children.    - **Cousins from Mother's Side**: Alice's sisters have 2 cousins from their mother's brothers.  3. **Father's Side**:    - **Father's Siblings**: Alice's father has 1 brother who has 1 son.    - **Uncle's Nephews and Nieces**: The uncle has 4 nephews and nieces.

Since she has no children, these are the children of her siblings (M, MB1, MB2). - Alice's mother has 4 daughters (Alice and her 3 sisters). - Therefore, the remaining nephews and nieces (6 total - 4 from Alice's mother) are from MB1 and MB2. - This means MB1 and MB2 have a total of 2 children.
