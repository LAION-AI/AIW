        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's carefully consider the given information step by step.  **People Involved:** - Alice - 3 male friends: Let's call them M1, M2, M3. - 6 female friends: Let's call them F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, F6.  **Given Conditions:** 1. Alice is friends with all 9 of these people. 2. \"They all are friends with each other,\" which means every person is friends with every other person in this group. 3. They have no other friends outside this group.  **Question:** - How many female friends does one of Alice's male friends have?  **Breaking It Down:** - Let's pick one male friend, say M1. - M1 is friends with everyone else in the group (because \"they all are friends with each other\"). - This means M1's friends are:   - Alice (female)   - The other 2 male friends: M2 and M3   - The 6 female friends: F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, F6  **Calculating Female Friends of M1:** - Female friends are:   - Alice   - F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, F6 - Total female friends = 1 (Alice) + 6 (F1-F6) = **7 female friends**  **Final Answer:** ### Answer: 7",

        "model_response":"To determine how many female friends a male friend of Alice has, let's analyze the social network described:  - Total people involved: Alice, 3 male friends, and 6 female friends, making a total of 10 people. - All of these people are friends with each other, implying that every person is connected to every other person in the group. - They have no other friends aside from this group.  For a male friend of Alice (let's call him M1): - His friends include: Alice, 2 other male friends (M2 and M3), and 6 female friends (F1-F6). - Total friends of M1: 9 people (everyone except himself).  Of these 9 friends, the female friends are: - Alice - 6 female friends (F1-F6) - Total female friends: 7  Therefore, each male friend of Alice has **7 female friends**.  ### Answer: 7",
