        "model_response":"To determine how many cousins Alice's sister has, let's break down the information step by step:  1. **Alice's Immediate Family:**    - Alice has 2 sisters, making a total of 3 daughters in the family (Alice and her 2 sisters).  2. **Mother's Side:**    - **Mother's Siblings:**      - 1 sister (childless, so no cousins from her side).      - 2 brothers.    - **Cousins from Mother's Siblings:**      - The mother's 2 brothers have a total of 3 children (since the mother's sister has 6 nephews and nieces, which include Alice and her 2 sisters plus these 3 children).      - Therefore, from the mother's side, there are 3 cousins.  3. **Father's Side:**    - **Father's Sibling:**      - 1 brother.    - **Cousins from Father's Sibling:**      - The father's brother has 4 nephews and nieces in total. However, these nephews and nieces are actually Alice and her siblings themselves.      - Since cousins are children of aunts or uncles, and there are no additional siblings mentioned on the father's side who have children, there are no cousins from the father's side.  4. **Total Cousins:**    - Summing up the cousins from both sides, Alice's sister has a total of **3 cousins** from her mother's side.  ### Answer: 3",
