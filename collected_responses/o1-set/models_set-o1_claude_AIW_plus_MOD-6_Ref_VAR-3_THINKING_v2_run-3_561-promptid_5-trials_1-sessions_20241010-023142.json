Since Alice's father has **4 children**, the **2 sisters must have 1 child between them** (because 4 children from Alice's father + 1 child from the sisters = 5 nephews and nieces).    - Therefore, the **2 sisters have 1 child total**, and the brother has **1 son**.  4. **Total Cousins**:    - On the **maternal side**, Alice's siblings have **3 cousins** (children of the 2 maternal uncles).    - On the **paternal side**, they have **2 cousins** (1 child from the brother and 1 from the sisters).    - **Total cousins** = **3 (maternal) + 2 (paternal) = 5 cousins**.  ### Answer: 5",

Alice's father's side:    * Alice's father has 2 sisters.    * Alice's father also has a brother.    * This brother has 5 nephews and nieces in total.    * Out of these 5 nephews and nieces, 1 is his own son.    * So, the remaining 4 are Alice's cousins from her father's side.  4. Total number of Alice's cousins:    * From her mother's side: 7 cousins    * From her father's side: 4 cousins    * Total: 7 + 4 = 11 cousins  5. Alice's sister's cousins:    * Alice and her sister have the same cousins.    * Therefore, Alice's sister also has 11 cousins.  Double-checking the solution: * The given information is correctly used in the calculation. * The total number of cousins is correctly calculated by adding the cousins from both sides of the family. * The logic that Alice's sister has the same number of cousins as Alice is correct.  ### Answer: Alice's sister has 11 cousins.",
