Including Alice, there are **4 sisters** in total.  3. **Bob's Siblings:**    - Bob has **6 brothers**. Assuming this means Bob has 6 other brothers besides himself, there are **7 brothers** in total (including Bob).  4. **Total Brothers:**    - Since Alice is female, she doesn't count as a brother. Therefore, Alice has **6 brothers** (the same number of brothers Bob has, excluding himself).  ### Answer: 6",
