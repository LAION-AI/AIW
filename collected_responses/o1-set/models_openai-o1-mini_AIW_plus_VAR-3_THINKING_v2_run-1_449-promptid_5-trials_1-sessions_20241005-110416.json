        "model_response":"Let's break down the problem step by step:  1. **Alice's Immediate Family:**    - Alice has 3 sisters, making a total of 4 siblings.  2. **Mother's Side:**    - Alice's mother has 1 sister (a maternal aunt) who has no children.    - This maternal aunt has 2 brothers (maternal uncles).    - These 2 maternal uncles have a total of 7 children (Alice's maternal cousins).  3. **Father's Side:**    - Alice's father has 1 brother (paternal uncle).    - This paternal uncle has 5 nephews and nieces.    - Since Alice and her 3 sisters make up 4 of these, there is likely 1 additional child from another sibling, but based on the information given, we'll consider the total on the paternal side as 5 cousins.  4. **Total Cousins:**    - **Maternal cousins:** 7    - **Paternal cousins:** 5    - **Total cousins:** 7 + 5 = 12  Therefore, Alice's sister has **12** cousins.  ### Answer: 12",
