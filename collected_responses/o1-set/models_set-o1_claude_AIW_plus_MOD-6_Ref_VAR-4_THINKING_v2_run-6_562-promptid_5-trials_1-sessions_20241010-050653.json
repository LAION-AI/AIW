Now, let's look at Alice's mother's side:    - Her mother has 2 brothers    - Her mother has 1 sister who doesn't have children    - The sister has 6 nephews and nieces in total  3. Looking at Alice's father's side:    - Her father has 2 sisters    - Her father has 1 brother    - This brother has 5 nephews and nieces in total    - This brother has 1 daughter  4. Now, let's count the cousins:    - From mother's side:      * 2 uncles, but we don't know if they have children    - From father's side:      * 2 aunts, but we don't know if they have children      * 1 uncle who has 1 daughter  5.

Double-checking the information:    - Alice's mother's sister has 6 nephews and nieces in total    - This matches with Alice and her 4 siblings (5 in total), plus the 1 cousin from father's brother    - This confirms our count so far  6. Alice's father's brother has 5 nephews and nieces in total:    - This also matches with Alice and her 4 siblings  7. The key point:    - The question asks about Alice's sister's cousins, not Alice's cousins    - Alice's sister would have the same cousins as Alice  Therefore, based on the information given, we can only be certain about one cousin - the daughter of Alice's father's brother.  ### Answer: 1",

First, let's identify Alice's family structure:    - Alice has 1 sister and 3 brothers (4 siblings in total)    - Alice's mother has 2 brothers and 1 sister    - Alice's father has 2 sisters and 1 brother  2. Now, let's look at Alice's aunts and uncles:    - Mother's side: 2 uncles and 1 aunt    - Father's side: 2 aunts and 1 uncle  3. We're told that Alice's mother's sister (aunt) doesn't have children, so we can exclude her.  4. We're also told that Alice's father's brother (uncle) has 1 daughter.  5. To find Alice's sister's cousins, we need to count the children of Alice's aunts and uncles, excluding Alice and her siblings.  6. We're given two pieces of information about nephews and nieces:    - Alice's mother's sister has 6 nephews and nieces in total    - Alice's father's brother has 5 nephews and nieces in total  7. The 6 nephews and nieces of Alice's mother's sister include Alice and her 4 siblings (5 in total). So there's 1 additional cousin from this side.  8. The 5 nephews and nieces of Alice's father's brother include Alice and her 4 siblings. This means there are no additional cousins from this uncle, apart from the 1 daughter we already know about.  9. So far, we have:    - 1 cousin from mother's side    - 1 cousin (daughter) from father's brother  10. We still don't know if Alice's mother's brothers or father's sisters have any children. The problem doesn't give us this information, so we can't include any potential cousins from these aunts and uncles.  11. Therefore, the total number of cousins we can confirm is 2.  ### Answer: 2",

        "model_response":"Okay, let's break this down step by step:  1. Alice has 1 sister and 3 brothers, which means she has 4 siblings in total.  2. Alice's mother has 2 brothers. The children of these brothers would be Alice's cousins. However, we don't know how many children each of these brothers has.  3. Alice's mother also has 1 sister who doesn't have children. This sister has 6 nephews and nieces in total. These nephews and nieces are the children of Alice's mother's brothers (from step 2). So, the 2 brothers have 6 children in total.  4. Alice's father has 2 sisters. The children of these sisters would also be Alice's cousins. Again, we don't know how many children each of these sisters has.  5. Alice's father also has a brother who has 1 daughter. This daughter is Alice's cousin. Additionally, this brother has 5 nephews and nieces in total. Since he has 1 daughter, the remaining 4 must be the children of Alice's father's 2 sisters (from step 4).  6. Now, let's count the total number of Alice's cousins:    - From her mother's side: 6 cousins (children of her mother's 2 brothers)    - From her father's side: 1 cousin (daughter of her father's brother) + 4 cousins (children of her father's 2 sisters) = 5 cousins  7. In total, Alice has 6 + 5 = 11 cousins.  8. Since Alice has 1 sister, her sister will have the same number of cousins as Alice.  Double-checking the solution: - The given information is consistent and there are no contradictions. - The total number of cousins is correctly calculated based on the information provided about Alice's aunts and uncles and their children.  ### Answer: Alice's sister has 11 cousins.",
