        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.  1. **Identify the total number of sisters and brothers in the family:**     - **Alice has 1 sister.** Since this is in addition to herself, there are **2 sisters** in total.     - **Bob has 4 brothers.** Including Bob himself (since he is a brother too), there are **5 brothers** in total.  2. **Determine the total number of siblings:**     - **Total siblings = Total sisters + Total brothers = 2 + 5 = 7 siblings.**  3. **Find out how many brothers Alice has:**     - Since Alice is one of the sisters, her brothers are the remaining siblings who are boys.     - Therefore, **Alice has 5 brothers**.  ### Answer: 5 brothers",

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we need to deduce the total number of siblings in the family and specifically focus on Alice's brothers.  1. **Alice has 1 sister**: This means there are **2 girls** in the family (Alice and her sister).  2. **Bob has 4 brothers**: This implies there are **5 boys** in the family (Bob and his 4 brothers).  3. **Total number of siblings**: Adding the number of girls and boys together gives us **7 children** in the family (2 girls + 5 boys).  4. **Number of brothers Alice has**: Since Alice is one of the sisters, her brothers are all the boys in the family.
