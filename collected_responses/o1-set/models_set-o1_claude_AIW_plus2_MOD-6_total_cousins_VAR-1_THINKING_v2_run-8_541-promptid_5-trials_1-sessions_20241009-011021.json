        "model_response":"Let's think through this step-by-step:  1. We need to count Alice's cousins, which will be the same number as Alice's sister's cousins.  2. Cousins come from aunts and uncles, so we need to look at Alice's parents' siblings.  3. From Alice's mother's side:    - Her mother has 2 brothers    - Her mother has 1 sister, but she doesn't have children  4. From Alice's father's side:    - Her father has 2 sisters    - Her father has 1 brother  5. Now, let's count the children of these aunts and uncles:    - Mother's 2 brothers: We don't have information about their children    - Mother's sister: No children    - Father's 2 sisters: We don't have information about their children    - Father's brother: He has 2 sons  6. We're told that Alice's father's brother has 1 nephew and 4 nieces in total.     - The 1 nephew must be one of Alice's brothers    - The 4 nieces must include Alice, her sister, and two other girls  7. This means that Alice's father's 2 sisters must have 2 daughters in total (to make up the 4 nieces when added to Alice and her sister)  8. So, the total number of cousins is:    - 2 sons from father's brother    - 2 daughters from father's sisters    - 0 from mother's siblings  9. Therefore, the total number of cousins is 4.  Let's double-check: - We've accounted for all the aunts and uncles mentioned - We've only counted children of aunts and uncles, not Alice and her siblings - The numbers match with the information given about nieces and nephews  ### Answer: 4",

On Alice's father's side:    - Her father has 2 sisters    - Her father has 1 brother    - This uncle has 1 nephew and 4 nieces    - This uncle also has 2 sons  4. To find Alice's sister's cousins, we need to count the children of Alice's aunts and uncles:    - On mother's side: The 2 uncles might have children, but we don't have information about them    - On father's side: We know one uncle has 2 sons  5. The key information is about Alice's father's brother:    - He has 1 nephew and 4 nieces in total    - We know Alice, her sister, and her brother account for 3 of these (2 nieces and 1 nephew)    - This means there must be 2 more nieces from Alice's father's sisters  6. So, the cousins of Alice's sister are:    - 2 sons from father's brother    - 2 children (daughters) from father's sisters  7. Double-checking:    - We don't count Alice or her brother as cousins    - We don't have information about any children from mother's brothers    - The aunt on mother's side has no children  Therefore, Alice's sister has 4 cousins in total.  ### Answer: 4",

Now, let's look at the children of these aunts and uncles:        Mother's side:    - The aunt has no children    - We don't have information about the uncles' children     Father's side:    - One uncle has 2 sons    - We don't have information about the aunts' children  3. Let's count the known cousins:    - 2 cousins from father's brother  4. Now, let's look at the information about nephews and nieces:    - Mother's sister has 2 nephews and 4 nieces    - Father's brother has 1 nephew and 4 nieces  5. We need to be careful here. These nephews and nieces include Alice, her siblings, and potentially other cousins.  6. We know Alice has 1 sister and 1 brother. That accounts for 2 nieces and 1 nephew.  7. For the mother's sister:    - 2 nephews: Alice's brother and 1 cousin    - 4 nieces: Alice, Alice's sister, and 2 cousins  8. For the father's brother:    - 1 nephew: Alice's brother    - 4 nieces: Alice, Alice's sister, and 2 other cousins (his own daughters)  9. Combining this information, we can conclude that Alice's cousins are:    - 2 sons of father's brother    - 1 male cousin from mother's side    - 2 female cousins from mother's side  10.
