We don't know how many children his 2 sisters have.  After reviewing the problem, it appears that there is not enough information to determine the exact number of cousins Alice's sister has. We would need to know the number of children Alice's mother's brothers have and the number of children Alice's father's sisters have.  ### Answer: There is not enough information provided to determine the exact number of cousins Alice's sister has.",

Alice's mother has 2 brothers. These brothers are Alice's uncles, and their children would be Alice's cousins. However, we don't know how many children they have.  3. Alice's mother also has 1 sister who does not have children. This aunt has 6 nephews and nieces in total. Since Alice has 1 sister and 3 brothers, and this aunt doesn't have children, the remaining 2 nephews\/nieces must be from Alice's father's side.  4. Alice's father has 2 sisters.

This means that out of the 5 nephews and nieces, 4 are Alice and her siblings (1 sister + 3 brothers). The remaining 1 niece\/nephew is from another sibling of Alice's father.  6. Now, let's count the cousins of Alice's sister:    - From Alice's mother's side: We don't know the exact number of cousins.    - From Alice's father's side:      - 1 cousin from the father's brother (the remaining niece\/nephew out of the 5 total)      - Unknown number of cousins from the father's 2 sisters.  7.
