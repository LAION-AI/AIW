        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's carefully identify all the individuals involved and their relationships:  1. **Alice** (female) 2. **Bob** (male) 3. **Alice's 6 male friends**:    - Since Alice has 6 male friends and \"all mentioned persons are friends with each other,\" these friends are part of the group. 4. **Bob's 4 female friends**:    - Bob has 4 female friends, who are also part of the group due to the same reasoning.  So, the total number of people in the group is: - Alice (1) + Bob (1) + Alice's 6 male friends (6) + Bob's 4 female friends (4) = **12 people**.  Now, let's determine how many **female friends** Alice has: - Alice is friends with everyone in the group (since \"all mentioned persons are friends with each other\"), excluding herself. - The female friends in the group, besides Alice herself, are Bob's 4 female friends. - Therefore, Alice has **4 female friends**.  ### Answer: 4",

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's begin by listing all the people involved:  1. **Alice** (Female) 2. **Bob** (Male) 3. **Alice's 6 male friends** (6 Males) 4. **Bob's 4 female friends** (4 Females)  So, the total number of people is:  - **Total Females**: Alice + Bob's 4 female friends = **5 Females** - **Total Males**: Bob + Alice's 6 male friends = **7 Males**  This gives us a group of **12 people** (5 Females + 7 Males).  According to the problem, **all mentioned persons are friends with each other**. This means:  - **Alice** is friends with the other **11 people** in the group. - Among these 11 friends, there are **7 Males** and **4 Females** (since Alice herself is a female and is not counted among her own friends).  Therefore, **Alice has 4 female friends**, which are Bob's 4 female friends.  ### Answer: 4",

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's carefully reconstruct the social group based on the information provided.  1. **Total People Involved:**    - Alice (female)    - Bob (male)    - Alice's male friends: She has **6 male friends**. Since Bob is male and they are friends, *Bob is included* in this count. Therefore, there are **5 other male friends** besides Bob.    - Bob's female friends: He has **4 female friends**. Since Alice is female and they are friends, *Alice is included* in this count. Therefore, there are **3 other female friends** besides Alice.  2. **Group Composition:**    - Total males: Bob + 5 other males = **6 males**    - Total females: Alice + 3 other females = **4 females**    - **Total people in the group: 6 males + 4 females = 10 people**  3. **Friendships:**    - Because \"all mentioned persons are friends with each other,\" the group forms a complete network. Each person has friends with every other person in the group except themselves.    - Therefore, each person has **9 friends** (since there are 10 people total).  4. **Alice's Friends:**    - Male friends: Bob + 5 other males = **6 male friends** (as stated).    - Female friends: The 3 other female members of the group.    - **Alice has 3 female friends.**  **Answer: 3**",
