These nephews and nieces are Alice's siblings' children:      - Alice, Sister A, and Brother have a total of 7 children among them.  5. **Paternal Uncle's Family:**    - The Paternal Uncle has 1 son.    - He also has 5 nephews and nieces, which are the children of his siblings (Alice's father and his two sisters).       - Since Alice's father has siblings, the 5 nephews and nieces are distributed among them.  6. **Calculating Cousins:**    - **Children from Mother's Side:**      - 2 Maternal Uncles. The number of children they have isn't directly specified, but based on the information about the Paternal Uncle, we can deduce relationships.    - **Children from Father's Side:**      - 2 Paternal Aunts and 1 Paternal Uncle.      - Paternal Uncle has 1 son.      - The 5 nephews and nieces mentioned for the Paternal Uncle likely come from the combined children of the Paternal Aunts and possibly extended family.  7. **Total Cousins:**    - Adding up the known cousins:      - 7 children from Alice's siblings.      - 1 son from the Paternal Uncle.      - 5 additional nephews and nieces associated with the Paternal Uncle.    - **Total Cousins = 7 + 1 + 5 = 13**  **However**, considering that the 5 nephews and nieces include the 7 children from Alice's siblings, there might be an overlap.
