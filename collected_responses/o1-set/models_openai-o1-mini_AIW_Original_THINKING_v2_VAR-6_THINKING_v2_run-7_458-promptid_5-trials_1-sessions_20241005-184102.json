        "model_response":"Let's break down the problem step by step to ensure accuracy:  1. **Understanding the Sibling Structure:**    - Alice has **5 sisters**.    - Alice has **3 brothers**.  2. **Interpreting \"Sisters\":**    - Typically, when someone states they have a certain number of sisters, it **excludes themselves**. Therefore, Alice's count of 5 sisters does **not** include her.  3. **Total Siblings:**    - **Sisters:** 5 (excluding Alice)    - **Brothers:** 3    - **Including Alice:** Adding Alice herself, there are **6 daughters** in total (5 sisters + Alice).  4. **Determining the Number of Sisters Alice's Brother Has:**    - Each of Alice's brothers would have the same number of sisters.    - Since there are **5 sisters plus Alice**, each brother has **6 sisters**.  However, based on the standard interpretation where \"sisters\" typically excludes the person themselves, if we consider only the other sisters, the number of sisters Alice's brother has is **5**.  ### Answer: 5",
