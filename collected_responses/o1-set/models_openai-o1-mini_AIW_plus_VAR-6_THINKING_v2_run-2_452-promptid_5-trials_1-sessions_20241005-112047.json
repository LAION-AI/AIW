        "model_response":"To determine how many cousins Alice's sister has, let's break down the information step by step:  1. **Mother's Side:**    - **Mother's Siblings:** The mother has 1 sister (who has no children) and 2 brothers.    - **Children of Mother's Brothers:** These 2 brothers have a total of 6 children. These children are Alice's cousins from her mother's side.  2. **Father's Side:**    - **Father's Siblings:** The father has at least 2 brothers.      - **Brother 1:** Has 2 daughters. These daughters are Alice's nieces.      - **Brother 2:** Since Brother 1 has a total of 4 nephews and nieces, the remaining 2 must come from this brother. Therefore, Brother 2 has 2 children.    - **Total from Father's Side:** 2 (from Brother 1) + 2 (from Brother 2) = 4 cousins.  3. **Total Cousins:**    - **From Mother's Side:** 6 cousins.    - **From Father's Side:** 4 cousins.    - **Overall Total:** 6 + 4 = 10 cousins.  Therefore, **Alice's sister** has the same number of cousins as Alice, which is **10**.  ### Answer: 10",
