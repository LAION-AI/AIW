        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of cousins Alice's sister has, considering both her mother's and father's sides of the family.  **On Alice's Mother's Side:**  1. Alice's mother has **1 sister** who **does not have children**. 2. This sister has **6 nephews and nieces** and **2 brothers** (Alice's uncles). 3. The **6 nephews and nieces** are the children of Alice's mother and her two brothers. 4. Alice's mother has **4 daughters** (Alice and her 3 sisters). 5. Therefore, the two brothers have **2 children** collectively (since 6 - 4 = 2). 6. So, on her mother's side, Alice's sister has **2 cousins** from her uncles.  **On Alice's Father's Side:**  1. Alice's father has **1 brother** who has **1 son** (Alice's cousin). 2. This brother has **4 nephews and nieces**, who are Alice and her sisters. 3. So, on her father's side, Alice's sister has **1 cousin**.  **Total Cousins:**  - **Mother's side:** 2 cousins - **Father's side:** 1 cousin - **Total:** 2 + 1 = **3 cousins**  ### Answer: 3",
