From Alice's mother's side: - **Alice's mother's children** (Alice and her siblings): **1 nephew** (the brother) and **3 nieces** (Alice and her 2 sisters). - Therefore, the **other nephews and nieces** (from the 2 brothers) must be **2 nephews** and **1 niece** (since the aunt has a total of 3 nephews and 4 nieces).    Thus, on the maternal side, there are: - **2 sons** and **1 daughter** from the two brothers.  **Paternal Side (Alice's Father's Siblings and Their Children):** - Alice's father has **2 sisters** and **1 brother**. - The brother (Alice's uncle) has **1 son**. - This uncle has **1 nephew and 4 nieces** (his siblings' children).    From Alice's father's side: - **Alice's father's children** (Alice and her siblings): **1 nephew** (the brother) and **3 nieces** (Alice and her 2 sisters) for the uncle. - There must be **1 additional niece** from the sisters (since the uncle has 4 nieces in total).    Thus, on the paternal side, there are: - **1 son** from the brother. - **1 daughter** from the sisters.  **Total Cousins Alice's Sister Has:** - **Maternal Side:** **3 cousins** (2 sons and 1 daughter). - **Paternal Side:** **2 cousins** (1 son and 1 daughter). - **Total:** **3 + 2 = 5 cousins**.  ### Answer: 5",
