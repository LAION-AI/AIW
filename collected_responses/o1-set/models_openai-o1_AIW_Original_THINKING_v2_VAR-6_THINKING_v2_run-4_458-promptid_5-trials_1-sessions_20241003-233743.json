        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:  1. **Determine the total number of sisters**:    - Alice says she has **5 sisters**.    - Typically, when someone says they have 5 sisters, it means **they have 5 sisters besides themselves**.    - Therefore, including Alice, there are **6 sisters** in total.  2. **Determine the total number of brothers**:    - Alice says she has **3 brothers**.    - This means there are **3 brothers** in the family.  3. **Calculate the total number of children in the family**:    - Total children = **6 sisters (including Alice) + 3 brothers** = **9 children**.  4. **Find out how many sisters Alice's brother has**:    - Each of Alice's brothers is one of the **3 brothers**.    - When considering siblings, we **exclude the person themselves**.    - Therefore, each brother does not count himself among the siblings.    - So, each brother has:      - **Brothers**: 2 (the other two brothers).      - **Sisters**: The total number of sisters, which is **6**.    - Therefore, **each brother has 6 sisters**.  ### Answer: 6",
