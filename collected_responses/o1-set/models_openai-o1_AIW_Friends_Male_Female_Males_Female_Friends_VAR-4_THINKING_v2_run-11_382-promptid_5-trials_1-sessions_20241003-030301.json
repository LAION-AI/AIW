        "model_response":"To solve this problem step by step:  1. **Identify the total group of friends:** There are 6 people in total \u2014 Alice, 4 male friends, and 1 female friend.     2. **Understand the friendship connections:** Everyone is friends with each other, forming a complete network. This means every person has 5 friends (since there are 6 people total and each person is friends with the other 5).     3. **Focus on a male friend of Alice:** Let's consider any one of Alice's male friends, say Bob.     4. **Determine Bob's friends:**    - **Female friends:** Alice and the other female friend.    - **Male friends:** The remaining 3 male friends.     5. **Count the number of female friends Bob has:** He is friends with both Alice and the other female friend.     6. **Final Answer:** Bob, being a male friend of Alice, has **2 female friends**.  ### Answer: 2",

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's break down the information:  - Alice has 4 male friends (let's call them M1, M2, M3, M4) and 1 female friend (let's call her F1). - All her friends are friends with each other. - They have no other friends outside this group.  So the group consists of: - Alice - M1, M2, M3, M4 - F1  Since all of Alice's friends are friends with each other, each male friend is friends with: - Alice (female) - F1 (female) - The other 3 male friends  Therefore, each male friend has **2 female friends** (Alice and F1).  ### Answer: 2",
