First, let's identify Alice's immediate family:    - Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother    - So, Alice's parents have 4 children in total  2. Now, let's look at Alice's mother's side:    - Alice's mother has 2 brothers    - Alice's mother has 1 sister who has no children    - This sister has 6 nephews and nieces in total  3. Looking at Alice's father's side:    - Alice's father has 2 sisters    - Alice's father has 1 brother    - This brother has 4 nephews and nieces in total and 1 son  4. To find Alice's sister's cousins, we need to count the children of Alice's aunts and uncles (excluding Alice and her siblings):     From mother's side:    - 2 uncles: We don't know if they have children or how many     From father's side:    - 2 aunts: We don't know if they have children or how many    - 1 uncle: We know he has 1 son  5.

This suggests that one of Alice's mother's brothers has 2 children.  3. Alice's father's side:    - 2 sisters of Alice's father    - 1 brother of Alice's father    The brother has 4 nephews and nieces (which matches Alice and her siblings) and 1 son of his own.  4.
