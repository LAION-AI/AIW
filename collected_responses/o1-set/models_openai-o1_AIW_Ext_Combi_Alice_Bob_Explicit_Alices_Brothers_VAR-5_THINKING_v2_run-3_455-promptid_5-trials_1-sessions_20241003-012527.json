        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's carefully analyze the information provided step by step:  1. **Alice and Bob are sister and brother**, which means they are siblings from the same family.  2. **Alice has 2 sisters**. Since this count excludes herself (as one doesn't count oneself when referring to siblings), there are **3 sisters in total** (Alice plus her 2 sisters).  3. **Bob has 3 brothers**. Similarly, excluding himself, there are **4 brothers in total** (Bob plus his 3 brothers).  4. Now, let's determine the total number of children in the family:    - **Total sisters**: 3    - **Total brothers**: 4    - **Total children**: 3 sisters + 4 brothers = **7 children**.  5. **How many brothers does Alice have?**    - The brothers in the family are Bob and his 3 brothers, totaling **4 brothers**.    - Since all siblings are from the same family, these brothers are also Alice's brothers.    - Therefore, **Alice has 4 brothers**.  ### Answer: 4",
