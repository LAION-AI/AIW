        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many first cousins Alice's sister has. Since Alice and her sister share the same cousins, we'll calculate the total number of cousins Alice has.  **On Alice's Mother's Side:** 1. Alice's mother has:    - 1 sister (Aunt) who has no children.    - 2 brothers.  2. The childless aunt has 6 nephews and nieces in total. These nephews and nieces are the children of her siblings (Alice's mother and her two brothers).  3. Alice's mother has 4 daughters (Alice and her 3 sisters).  4. Therefore, the two brothers together have:    - Total nephews and nieces: 6 (from the aunt's perspective).    - Nephews and nieces from Alice's mother: 4 (Alice and her sisters).    - Remaining nephews and nieces: 6 - 4 = **2** (children from the two brothers).  5. So, Alice has **2 cousins** on her mother's side from her uncles.  **On Alice's Father's Side:** 1. Alice's father has:    - 1 brother who has 1 son.    - At least one other sibling (since the brother has 5 nephews and nieces).  2. The father's brother has 5 nephews and nieces, who are the children of his siblings.  3. Alice's father has 4 daughters (Alice and her 3 sisters).  4. Therefore, the other sibling must have:    - Total nephews and nieces: 5 (from the brother's perspective).    - Nephews and nieces from Alice's father: 4 (Alice and her sisters).    - Remaining nephew or niece: 5 - 4 = **1** (child from the other sibling).  5. So, Alice has **2 cousins** on her father's side: one from her uncle (father's brother's son) and one from the other sibling.  **Total Cousins:** - Maternal cousins: **2** - Paternal cousins: **2** - **Total cousins Alice's sister has: 2 + 2 = 4**  ### Answer: 4",

        "model_response":"To determine the number of cousins Alice's sister has, let's break down the family relationships step by step.  **Alice's Immediate Family:** - Alice has **3 sisters**. This makes **4 siblings** (including Alice herself). However, considering the information from the problem, there must be more siblings.  **On Alice's Mother's Side:** - Alice's mother has:   - **1 sister (Aunt)** who **does not have children**.   - **2 brothers (Uncle1 and Uncle2)**. - The childless aunt has **6 nephews and nieces** in total. - The nieces and nephews come from her siblings:   - From Alice's mother: **Alice and her siblings**. We initially know of **4 siblings** (Alice and her 3 sisters).   - From Uncle1 and Uncle2: Let's denote the number of their children as **C**. - Total nieces and nephews: **4 (from Alice's mother) + C (from uncles) = 6**.   - Solving for C gives us **C = 2**. However, we realized Alice must have a brother, given other numbers in the problem.   - If Alice's family actually has **5 children** (Alice, 3 sisters, and **1 brother**), then **C = 6 - 5 = 1**. - Therefore, **Uncle1 and Uncle2 have 1 child in total**.    **On Alice's Father's Side:** - Alice's father has **a brother (UncleB)** who has:   - **1 son** (Alice's cousin).   - **5 nephews and nieces**. - The nephews and nieces come from his siblings:   - Since UncleB has only one sibling (Alice's father), and UncleB has **5 nephews and nieces**, Alice's father must have **5 children**.   - This matches the earlier conclusion that Alice's family has **5 children** (Alice, 3 sisters, and 1 brother).  **Total Cousins Alice's Sister Has:** - **Mother's side:** **1 cousin** (from Uncle1 and Uncle2). - **Father's side:** **1 cousin** (UncleB's son). - **Total cousins:** **1 + 1 = 2**.  ### Answer: 2",

        "model_response":"To solve this problem and find out how many cousins Alice's sister has, we'll need to carefully reconstruct Alice's family tree based on the given information.  1. **Alice's Immediate Family**:    - Alice has **3 sisters**. So, including Alice herself, there are **4 sisters**.    - From information on Alice's father's side, we deduce that Alice has a **brother** too (explained later).    - So, Alice's immediate family consists of **5 children**: Alice, her 3 sisters, and 1 brother.  2. **Alice's Mother's Siblings**:    - Alice's mother has **1 sister** who does not have children and has **6 nephews and nieces**.    - She also has **2 brothers**.    - The sister's nephews and nieces are her siblings' children.    - Alice's mother has **5 children** (from step 1).    - Therefore, the combined children of the two brothers must be **1 child** (since 6 nephews and nieces - 5 from Alice's mother = 1 from the brothers).    - So, from Alice's mother's side, there is **1 cousin**.  3. **Alice's Father's Siblings**:    - Alice's father has **1 brother** who has **5 nephews and nieces** in total and **1 son**.    - The brother's nephews and nieces are his sibling's children.    - Since the brother has only one sibling (Alice's father), Alice's father must have **5 children** (which aligns with step 1).    - The uncle has **1 son**.    - So, from Alice's father's side, there is **1 cousin**.  4. **Total Cousins**:    - Cousins are the children of one's aunts and uncles.    - From Alice's mother's side: **1 cousin**.    - From Alice's father's side: **1 cousin**.    - **Total cousins** Alice\u2019s sister has: **1 + 1 = 2 cousins**.  **Answer: 2**",

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we'll step through the information methodically.  **Variables:** - Let \\( x \\) be the number of Alice's siblings (including Alice herself). - Let \\( y \\) be the total number of children of Alice's two maternal uncles. - Let \\( z \\) be the total number of children of any other paternal siblings (excluding the uncle mentioned). - Alice's sister's total cousins will be \\( y + z + 1 \\) (the \\( +1 \\) accounts for the son of the paternal uncle).  **From the maternal side:** - The aunt has 6 nephews and nieces from her siblings: Alice's mother and her two brothers. - Equation: \\( x + y = 6 \\) (since \\( x \\) is the number of Alice's mother's children and \\( y \\) is the number of her brothers\u2019 children).  **From the paternal side:** - The uncle has 5 nephews and nieces from his siblings. - Equation: \\( x + z = 5 \\) (since \\( x \\) is the number of Alice's father's children and \\( z \\) is the number of other siblings\u2019 children).  **Relation between \\( y \\) and \\( z \\):** - From subtracting the two equations: \\( (x + y) - (x + z) = 6 - 5 \\), resulting in \\( y - z = 1 \\), so \\( z = y - 1 \\).  We consider possible integer values for \\( x \\) (number of Alice's siblings) starting from 4 (since Alice has 3 sisters and possibly herself as well).  1.

There's no mention of brothers, but considering later facts, it's logical to infer that she also has a brother. This means Alice's parents have **5 children** (Alice, her 3 sisters, and a brother).  2. **Mother's Side**:    - **Alice's Mother (M)** has **5 children**.    - M has a sister (S1) who has **no children**.    - S1 has **6 nephews and nieces**, who are the children of M and her two brothers (B1 and B2).    - Since M has 5 children, B1 and B2 together must have **1 child** (because 5 children from M + 1 child from B1\/B2 = 6 nephews\/nieces for S1).    - Thus, on her mother's side, Alice has **1 cousin** (the child of B1 or B2).  3. **Father's Side**:    - **Alice's Father** has a brother (FB) who has **5 nephews and nieces**.    - The nephews and nieces are the children of his siblings. Since FB and Alice's father are likely the only siblings, Alice's father must have **5 children** (matching the 5 nephews\/nieces FB has).    - FB also has **1 son**.    - Thus, on her father's side, Alice has **1 cousin** (FB's son).  4. **Total Cousins for Alice's Sister**:    - Adding the cousins from both sides, Alice's sister has **1 cousin on her mother's side** and **1 cousin on her father's side**, totaling **2 cousins**.  ### Answer: 2",
