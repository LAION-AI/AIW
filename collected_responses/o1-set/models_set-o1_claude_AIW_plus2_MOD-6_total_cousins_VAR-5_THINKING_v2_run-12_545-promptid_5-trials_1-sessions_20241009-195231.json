Let's focus on Alice's uncle (father's brother):    - He has 1 nephew and 4 nieces in total    - He has 1 son  5. Now, to find Alice's sister's cousins, we need to count the children of Alice's aunts and uncles:    - From mother's side:       * 2 uncles, but we don't know if they have children      * 1 aunt with no children    - From father's side:      * 2 aunts, but we don't know if they have children      * 1 uncle with 1 son  6.
