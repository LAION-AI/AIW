        "model_response":"To determine how many sisters Alice's brother has, let's break down the information step by step:  1. **Alice's Siblings:**    - **Brothers:** Alice has 3 brothers.    - **Sisters:** Alice has 6 sisters.  2. **Understanding the Relationship:**    - When it's stated that Alice has 6 sisters, it typically excludes herself. So, in total, there are:      - **Total Sisters (including Alice):** 6 sisters + Alice = 7 sisters.    - Each brother shares the same siblings.  3. **Calculating the Number of Sisters for Alice's Brother:**    - Each brother has the same set of sisters.    - Therefore, Alice's brother has **7 sisters**.  **Final Answer:**  ### Answer: 7",
