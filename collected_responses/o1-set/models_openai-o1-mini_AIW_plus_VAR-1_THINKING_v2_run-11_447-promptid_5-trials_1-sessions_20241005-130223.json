Since Alice's immediate family has **3 children**, this suggests there might be additional siblings or it could imply there are more children in the family. For simplicity and based on the information provided:        - **5 nephews and nieces** + **2 daughters of the uncle** = **7 cousins** from the paternal side.  4. **Total Cousins:**    - **Maternal Side:** 6 cousins    - **Paternal Side:** 7 cousins    - **Total:** 6 + 7 = **13 cousins**  ### Answer: Alice's sister has **13 cousins**.",

The uncle's nephews and nieces are the children of his siblings. Assuming the father has only one brother (the uncle mentioned), the uncle's 5 nephews and nieces must come from the father's side. However, since the mother has only 3 children (Alice and her 2 sisters) and the uncle has 5 nephews and nieces, it implies that there are additional children on the father's side to account for the total number of cousins.  **Total Cousins:** - **From Mother's Side:** 6 cousins. - **From Father's Side:** 5 cousins.  **Therefore, Alice's sister has a total of 11 cousins.**  ### Answer: 11",
