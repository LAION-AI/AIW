        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:  1. **Alice's siblings**: The problem states that *Alice has 4 sisters and 1 brother*. This means that Alice has 4 sisters (who are her siblings) and 1 brother (also her sibling). So, including Alice herself, there are:     - 5 sisters in total (Alice + 4 sisters)    - 1 brother  2. **Total number of children in the family**: Adding up, there are 6 children in the family:     - 5 sisters    - 1 brother  3. **Bob's siblings**: Bob is the brother of Alice. This means Bob is the only brother in the family (since Alice has only 1 brother). Therefore, Bob's siblings are:     - The 5 sisters (Alice + the 4 other sisters)    - No brothers (since he is the only boy)  4. **Answering the question**: The problem asks, *How many sisters does Bob have?* As we've established, Bob has 5 sisters.  ### Answer: 5",
