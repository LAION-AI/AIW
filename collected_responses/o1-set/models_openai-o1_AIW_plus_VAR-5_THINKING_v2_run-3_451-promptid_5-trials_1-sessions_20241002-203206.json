        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cousins Alice's sister has. A cousin is defined as a child of one's aunt or uncle.  **Step 1: Determine Alice's Immediate Family**  - Alice has **3 sisters**. - From additional information, we deduce that Alice also has **1 brother** (explained below).  **Step 2: Analyze Alice's Father's Side**  - Alice's father has **1 brother** (Uncle). - This uncle has:   - **1 son** (Alice's cousin).   - **5 nephews and nieces**. - The nephews and nieces of the uncle are the children of his siblings. Since he only has Alice's father as a sibling, the **5 nephews and nieces are Alice and her siblings**. - Therefore, Alice's parents have **5 children** (Alice, 3 sisters, and 1 brother).  **Step 3: Analyze Alice's Mother's Side**  - Alice's mother has:   - **1 sister** (childless aunt).   - **2 brothers** (Uncle 1 and Uncle 2). - The childless aunt has:   - **6 nephews and nieces**. - The nephews and nieces of the aunt are the children of her siblings (Alice's mother and her two brothers). - We know Alice's mother has **5 children** (from Step 2). - Therefore, the two uncles have **1 child** between them (since 6 - 5 = 1). - So, on Alice's mother's side, she has **1 cousin**.  **Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Cousins**  - **Paternal Cousins**: **1** (Uncle's son). - **Maternal Cousins**: **1** (Child of one of the maternal uncles). - **Total Cousins**: **1 + 1 = 2**.  ### Answer: 2",

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the family relationships provided.  **On Alice's Mother's Side:**  - Alice has 3 sisters, so there are **4 siblings** in her immediate family. - Alice's mother has:   - **1 sister** who has **no children**.   - **2 brothers**.  The childless sister has **6 nephews and nieces**. These are the children of her siblings (since she has no children of her own). Alice and her sisters account for **4** of these nephews and nieces.

So, Alice has **2 maternal cousins** (children of her maternal uncles).  **On Alice's Father's Side:**  - Alice's father has a **brother** who has **1 son**. - This brother has **5 nephews and nieces**. These are the children of his siblings.  Alice and her sisters account for **4** of these nephews and nieces. This means there's **1 more nephew\/niece** unaccounted for, implying that Alice's father has **another sibling** who has **1 child**.

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we'll determine the number of cousins that Alice's sister has, carefully parsing the family relationships provided.  1. **Alice's Immediate Family**:    - Alice has **3 sisters** and, as deduced, **1 brother**.       - How do we know about the brother? From the father's side: Alice's uncle has **5 nephews and nieces**. Since Alice's father has only one brother (the uncle mentioned), these nephews and nieces can only come from Alice's father. We already have Alice and her 3 sisters (4 children), so to make up 5 nephews and nieces, there must be a brother.  2. **Mother's Side**:    - Alice's mother has:      - **1 sister (Aunt1)** who has **no children**.      - **2 brothers** (Uncle1 and Uncle2).    - **Aunt1** has **6 nephews and nieces**, which are the children of her siblings (Alice's mother and her 2 brothers).       - Alice's mother has **5 children** (Alice, 3 sisters, and 1 brother).      - So, the 2 brothers must have **1 child each** (since 5 from Alice's mother + 1 + 1 = 7, but we are told Aunt1 has **6 nephews and nieces**, indicating there's a total of 6, so actually the brothers have **1 child in total**, implying one of the uncles has a child).  3. **Father's Side**:    - Alice's father has:      - **1 brother (Uncle3)** who has **1 son**.      - **Uncle3** has **5 nephews and nieces**, which are Alice and her siblings (since there are 5 of them, matching the 5 nephews and nieces).  4. **Total Cousins**:    - On the **mother's side**: **1 cousin** (the child of one of the uncles).    - On the **father's side**: **1 cousin** (Uncle3's son).    - **Total cousins**: **1 (maternal) + 1 (paternal) = 2 cousins**.  But wait, the total nephews and nieces on the mother's side don't add up unless both uncles have one child each (since 5 from Alice's mother + 1 from an uncle = 6). So both uncles together must have **1 child total**.  Therefore, the total number of cousins is **1 on the mother's side** and **1 on the father's side**, totaling **2 cousins**.  ### Answer: 2",
