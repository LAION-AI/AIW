        "model_response":"Let's think through this step-by-step:  1. First, let's identify Alice's siblings:    - Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother    - So, Alice's parents have 4 children in total  2. Now, let's look at Alice's mother's side:    - Alice's mother has 2 brothers    - Alice's mother has 1 sister (who has no children)    - This sister has 7 nephews and nieces in total  3. Let's examine Alice's father's side:    - Alice's father has 2 sisters    - Alice's father has 1 brother    - This brother has 1 son    - This brother has 5 nephews and nieces in total  4. To find Alice's sister's cousins, we need to count the children of Alice's aunts and uncles (excluding Alice and her siblings):     From mother's side:    - 2 uncles: We don't know how many children they have     From father's side:    - 2 aunts: We don't know how many children they have    - 1 uncle: We know he has 1 son  5. The key information is that Alice's father's brother has 5 nephews and nieces in total. This includes:    - Alice and her 3 siblings (4 in total)    - His own son (1)        This means all of Alice's father's siblings' children are accounted for (4 + 1 = 5).  6. Therefore, Alice's two paternal aunts don't have any children.  7. The only cousin we can confirm is the son of Alice's paternal uncle.  8. We don't have enough information about Alice's maternal uncles' children to include them in the count.  Therefore, based on the given information, we can only confirm one cousin for Alice's sister.  ### Answer: 1",

On Alice's father's side:    - Alice's father has 2 sisters    - Alice's father has 1 brother who has 1 son  4. Let's count the cousins:    - From mother's side:      * Mother's 2 brothers might have children, but we don't have information about them    - From father's side:      * Father's 2 sisters might have children, but we don't have specific information      * Father's brother has 1 son, which is a definite cousin  5. Additional information:    - Mother's sister (Alice's aunt) has 7 nephews and nieces in total    - Father's brother (Alice's uncle) has 5 nephews and nieces in total  6. Analyzing this information:    - The 7 nephews and nieces of mother's sister must include Alice and her 3 siblings (4 total)    - This means there are 3 other nephews\/nieces, which must be cousins from mother's brothers    - The 5 nephews and nieces of father's brother include Alice and her 3 siblings (4 total)    - The remaining 1 must be from one of father's sisters  7. Counting the cousins:    - 3 cousins from mother's side (mother's brothers' children)    - 1 cousin from father's side (father's brother's son)    - 1 cousin from father's side (child of one of father's sisters)  8.

Important realization:    The information about Alice's aunt (mother's sister) having 7 nephews and nieces, and Alice's uncle (father's brother) having 5 nephews and nieces doesn't directly tell us about cousins. These numbers include Alice, her siblings, and potentially other cousins.  6. The only cousin we can confirm for sure is the 1 son of Alice's father's brother.  7.
