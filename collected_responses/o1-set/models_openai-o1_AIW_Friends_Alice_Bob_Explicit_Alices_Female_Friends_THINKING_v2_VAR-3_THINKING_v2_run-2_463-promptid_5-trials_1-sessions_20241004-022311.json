        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we'll start by interpreting the information carefully.  We have a group of friends where: - Alice is female. - Bob is male. - \"All mentioned persons are friends with each other and have no other friends aside.\"    - This means the group is fully connected (everyone is friends with everyone else in the group) and no one has friends outside this group.  Given: - Alice has **3 male friends**. - Bob has **6 female friends**.  Let's define: - \\( n_f \\) = Total number of females in the group. - \\( n_m \\) = Total number of males in the group.  Since everyone is friends with everyone else, the number of male friends Alice has is \\( n_m \\) (since she is not counted among males). Similarly, the number of female friends Bob has is \\( n_f \\) (since he is not counted among females).  From the problem: 1. Alice has 3 male friends:    \\[    n_m = 3    \\] 2. Bob has 6 female friends:    \\[    n_f = 6    \\]  Now the total number of persons in the group is: \\[ n = n_f + n_m = 6 + 3 = 9 \\]  Since Alice is female, the number of female friends she has is: \\[ \\text{Female friends of Alice} = n_f - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5 \\] (We subtract 1 because we don't count Alice herself.)  ### Answer: 5",
