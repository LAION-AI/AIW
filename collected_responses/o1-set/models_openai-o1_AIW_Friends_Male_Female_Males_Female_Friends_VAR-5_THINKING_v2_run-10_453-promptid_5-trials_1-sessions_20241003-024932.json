        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many female friends a male friend of Alice has.   Alice has 2 male friends and 3 female friends. All of Alice's friends are friends with each other, and they have no other friends outside of this group. This means that the male friends are friends with:  1. Each other (the other male friend). 2. The three female friends. 3. Alice herself.  Since Alice is female and is friends with her male friends, we must include her in the count. Therefore, each male friend has 4 female friends: the three female friends and Alice.  ### Answer: 4",
