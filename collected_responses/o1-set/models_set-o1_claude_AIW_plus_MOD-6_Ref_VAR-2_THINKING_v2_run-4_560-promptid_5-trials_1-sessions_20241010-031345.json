On Alice's father's side:    - Her father has 2 sisters    - Her father has 1 brother    - This uncle has 4 nephews and nieces in total    - This uncle also has 1 son  4.

        "model_response":"Let's think through this step-by-step:  1. First, let's identify Alice's siblings:    - Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother    - So, Alice's parents have 4 children in total  2. Now, let's look at Alice's mother's side:    - Her mother has 2 brothers    - Her mother has 1 sister with no children    - The sister has 6 nephews and nieces in total  3. Alice's father's side:    - Her father has 2 sisters    - Her father has 1 brother    - This brother has 4 nephews and nieces and 1 son  4. Let's count the cousins:    - From mother's side:      * 2 uncles, but we don't know how many children they have    - From father's side:      * 2 aunts, but we don't know how many children they have      * 1 uncle with 1 son  5. The key information is:    - Alice's mother's sister has 6 nephews and nieces    - Alice's father's brother has 4 nephews and nieces  6. We know Alice and her siblings account for 4 of these nephews and nieces on both sides  7. So, on mother's side:    - 6 total nephews and nieces - 4 (Alice and her siblings) = 2 cousins  8. On father's side:    - 4 total nephews and nieces - 4 (Alice and her siblings) = 0 additional cousins    - But we know the uncle has 1 son, so that's 1 more cousin  9. Total cousins:    - 2 (from mother's side) + 1 (from father's side) = 3 cousins  10. Double-checking:     - This matches with the information given     - It explains why the aunt on mother's side has 6 nephews and nieces (4 + 2)     - It explains why the uncle on father's side has 4 nephews and nieces (4 + 0)  Therefore, Alice's sister has 3 cousins.  ### Answer: 3",

        "model_response":"Let's think through this problem step by step:  1. Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother, which means her sister has 1 sister (Alice) and 1 brother.  2. Alice's mother has 2 brothers. The children of these brothers would be Alice's cousins (and her sister's cousins). However, we don't know how many children they have.  3. Alice's mother also has 1 sister who does not have children. This sister has 6 nephews and nieces in total. These nephews and nieces would be the children of Alice's mother's brothers (from step 2). So, the 2 brothers have 6 children in total, which means Alice and her sister have 6 cousins from their mother's side.  4. Alice's father has 2 sisters. The children of these sisters would also be Alice's cousins (and her sister's cousins). However, we don't know how many children they have.  5. Alice's father also has a brother who has 4 nephews and nieces in total, and who also has 1 son. The 4 nephews and nieces would be the children of Alice's father's sisters (from step 4).

In total, Alice's sister has 6 cousins from her mother's side and 5 cousins from her father's side.  Double-checking the solution: - Alice's sister has 6 cousins from her mother's side (the children of her mother's 2 brothers). - Alice's sister has 5 cousins from her father's side (4 from her father's 2 sisters, and 1 from her father's brother). - The total number of cousins is 6 + 5 = 11.
