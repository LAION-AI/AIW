        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we'll analyze the information step by step.  **Alice's Immediate Family:** - Alice has **3 sisters**, so there are **4 daughters** in her immediate family.  **Mother's Side:** - Alice's mother has:   - **1 sister** who does **not have children**.   - **2 brothers**. - The mother has **7 nephews and nieces**. Since the sister doesn't have children, these 7 nephews and nieces are from the two brothers. - Therefore, Alice has **7 cousins** on her mother's side.  **Father's Side:** - Alice's father has a **brother** (Alice's uncle) who has **1 son** (Alice's cousin). - This uncle has **5 nephews and nieces**. - The nephews and nieces of the uncle are the children of his siblings. Alice and her sisters account for **4** of them. - Since there are **5 nephews and nieces**, there's an additional nephew or niece, meaning Alice's father has another sibling with **1 child**. - Therefore, Alice has **1 cousin** from this additional sibling.  **Total Cousins:** - **Mother's side:** 7 cousins. - **Father's side:** 1 (uncle's son) + 1 (from the other sibling) = **2 cousins**. - **Total:** 7 + 2 = **9 cousins**.  ### Answer: 9",

Including Alice herself, that's **4 daughters**.    - We are told that Alice's father has **5 children** (since his brother has **5 nephews and nieces**, which are his sibling's children). Therefore, Alice has **1 brother** (because \\(5 \\text{ children} - 4 \\text{ daughters} = 1 \\text{ son}\\)).  2. **Maternal Side**:    - Alice's mother has:      - **1 sister** who **does not have children**.      - **2 brothers**.    - Alice's mother has **7 nephews and nieces**.

Since the brother has only one sibling (Alice's father), these nephews and nieces must be Alice and her siblings. - This suggests that Alice and her siblings number 5, which includes Alice, her 3 sisters, and **1 brother**.  **Total Cousins:** - Maternal cousins: **7**. - Paternal cousin: **1**. - Total cousins: 7 (maternal) + 1 (paternal) = **8**.  ### Answer: 8",
