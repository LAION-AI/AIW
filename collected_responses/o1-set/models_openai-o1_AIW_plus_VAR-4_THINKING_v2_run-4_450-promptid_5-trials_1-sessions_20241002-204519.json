        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's carefully map out Alice's family tree and count her cousins step by step:  1. **Alice's Immediate Family:**    - Alice has **4 sisters**. This means Alice's parents have **5 daughters** in total (including Alice).  2. **Maternal Side:**    - **Alice's Mother** has:      - **1 sister (Aunt M1)** who has **no children**.      - **2 brothers (Uncle M2 and Uncle M3)**.    - **Aunt M1** has **6 nephews and nieces**. Since she has no children, these are the children of her siblings:      - **5 nieces** from Alice's mother (Alice and her 4 sisters).      - **1 nephew\/niece** from Uncle M2 or Uncle M3 (since there must be **6 total nephews and nieces**).    - Therefore, on the maternal side, Alice has **1 cousin** (the child of Uncle M2 or Uncle M3).  3. **Paternal Side:**    - **Alice's Father** has:      - **1 brother (Uncle P1)** who has **1 son**.      - **No mention of other siblings**.    - **Uncle P1** has **5 nephews and nieces**. Since he has only one sibling (Alice's father), his nephews and nieces are:      - **5 nieces** from Alice's father (Alice and her 4 sisters).    - Therefore, on the paternal side, Alice has **1 cousin** (the son of Uncle P1).  4. **Total Cousins:**    - **Maternal cousins**: **1**    - **Paternal cousins**: **1**    - **Total cousins** Alice's sister has: **1 + 1 = 2**  ### Answer: 2",

        "model_response":"To determine how many cousins Alice's sister has, let's carefully analyze the family tree:  1. **Alice's Siblings**: Alice has 4 sisters. So Alice's parents have at least 5 children (Alice and her 4 sisters). There's no mention of any brothers, so we'll consider only these 5 children.  2. **Father's Side**:    - Alice's father has a brother (Uncle) who has 1 son.    - This uncle has 5 nephews and nieces. His nephews and nieces are the children of his siblings. Since there's no mention of other siblings, these 5 nephews and nieces must be Alice and her 4 sisters (totaling 5).    - So, Alice's father has no other siblings, and Alice has 1 cousin on her father's side (the uncle's son).  3. **Mother's Side**:    - Alice's mother has:      - 1 sister who is childless.      - 2 brothers.    - The childless sister has 6 nephews and nieces. These are the children of her siblings (since she has none).    - We know Alice's mother has at least 5 children (Alice and her 4 sisters).    - This means the two brothers together have only 1 child (since 5 from Alice's mother + 1 = 6 total nephews\/nieces).    - So, Alice has 1 cousin on her mother's side (the child of one of her uncles).  **Total Cousins**: 1 (mother's side) + 1 (father's side) = 2 cousins.  ### Answer: 2",
