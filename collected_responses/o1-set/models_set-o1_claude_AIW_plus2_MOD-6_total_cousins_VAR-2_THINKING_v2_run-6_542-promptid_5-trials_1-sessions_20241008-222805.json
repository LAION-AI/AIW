        "model_response":"Let's think through this step by step:  1. First, we need to identify Alice's aunts and uncles:    - From her mother's side: 2 uncles and 1 aunt    - From her father's side: 2 aunts and 1 uncle  2. Now, let's look at which of these have children (Alice's cousins):    - Mother's side:      - We know the aunt doesn't have children      - We don't have information about the uncles' children    - Father's side:      - We know one uncle has 1 son      - We don't have information about the aunts' children  3. We need to be careful here. The problem gives us information about nephews and nieces, but these could be Alice and her siblings:    - Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother (4 children total)    - The father's brother has 1 nephew and 3 nieces total (4 children total)    - This matches exactly with Alice and her siblings  4. So, the only cousin we can confirm is the son of Alice's uncle on her father's side.  5. Alice's sister would have the same cousins as Alice.  Therefore, based on the information given, we can only confirm one cousin.  ### Answer: 1",

Now, let's look at Alice's mother's side:    - Her mother has 2 brothers    - Her mother has 1 sister who doesn't have children  3. On Alice's father's side:    - Her father has 2 sisters    - Her father has 1 brother  4. We need to count the children of Alice's aunts and uncles to find her cousins:     Mother's side:    - The mother's sister has no children    - The mother's 2 brothers: We don't have direct information about their children     Father's side:    - The father's 2 sisters: We don't have direct information about their children    - The father's brother has 1 son  5. Now, let's look at the additional information provided:    - The mother's sister (who has no children) has 2 nephews and 4 nieces in total    - The father's brother has 1 nephew and 3 nieces in total  6. We can deduce that:    - The 2 nephews and 4 nieces of the mother's sister must be Alice, her siblings, and cousins    - The 1 nephew and 3 nieces of the father's brother must be Alice, her siblings, and cousins  7. We know Alice and her siblings account for 1 nephew (Alice's brother) and 3 nieces (Alice and her 2 sisters)  8. Therefore, the remaining children must be Alice's cousins:    - From the mother's side information: 1 nephew and 1 niece    - From the father's side information: 1 son (explicitly mentioned)  9. In total, Alice has 3 cousins:    - 1 male cousin from her mother's side    - 1 female cousin from her mother's side    - 1 male cousin from her father's side  10. The question asks about Alice's sister's cousins. Since Alice and her sister share the same cousins, the answer remains 3.  ### Answer: 3",

This means Alice's parents have 4 children in total (Alice + 2 sisters + 1 brother).  2. Alice's mother has 2 brothers. The number of children these brothers have is not mentioned, so we cannot determine the number of cousins from the mother's side.  3. Alice's mother also has 1 sister who does not have children. This sister has 2 nephews and 4 nieces in total. These nieces and nephews are the children of Alice's mother's brothers (from step 2). So, the 2 brothers of Alice's mother have 6 children in total (2 nephews + 4 nieces).  4. Alice's father has 2 sisters. The number of children these sisters have is not mentioned, so we cannot determine the number of cousins from this information.  5. Alice's father also has a brother who has 1 nephew and 3 nieces in total, and who also has 1 son. This means that Alice's father's brother has 2 children (1 nephew + 1 son).

Now, let's count the total number of cousins Alice's sister has: - From the mother's side: 6 cousins (2 nephews + 4 nieces) - From the father's side: 2 cousins (1 nephew + 1 son of the father's brother)  Therefore, Alice's sister has a total of 8 cousins (6 from the mother's side + 2 from the father's side).
