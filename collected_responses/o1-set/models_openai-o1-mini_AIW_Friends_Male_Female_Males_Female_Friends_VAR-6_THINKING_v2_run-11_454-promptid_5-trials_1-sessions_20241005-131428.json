Since the situation is symmetrical for all male friends (M1, M2, M3), each male friend has **5 female friends**.  ### Answer: 5",

        "model_response":"To determine how many female friends a male friend of Alice has, let's break it down step by step:  1. **Alice's Friends:**    - **5 Female Friends**    - **3 Male Friends**  2. **Friendship Dynamics:**    - All 9 individuals (Alice + 5 female friends + 3 male friends) are friends with each other.    - They have no other friends outside this group.  3. **Analyzing a Male Friend's Female Friends:**    - A male friend is friends with:      - **Alice** (who is female)      - **5 Female Friends** of Alice  4. **Total Female Friends for a Male Friend:**    - This includes Alice plus the 5 female friends.    - **Total = 1 (Alice) + 5 = 6 Female Friends**  However, if the question intends to count only the female friends excluding Alice, the number would be **5**. Given the phrasing, it's more accurate to include Alice in the count.  ### Answer: 6",
