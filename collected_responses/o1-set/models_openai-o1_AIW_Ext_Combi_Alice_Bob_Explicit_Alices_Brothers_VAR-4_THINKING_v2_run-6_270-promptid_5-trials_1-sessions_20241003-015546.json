        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's carefully consider the information given:  1. **Alice and Bob are sister and brother.** This means they are siblings.  2. **Alice has 3 sisters.** This refers to sisters *other than herself*. So, including Alice, there are a total of 4 sisters.  3. **Bob has 1 brother.** This refers to brothers *other than himself*. So, including Bob, there are a total of 2 brothers.  Now, let's determine the total number of siblings in the family:  - **Total sisters:** 4 (Alice + 3 sisters) - **Total brothers:** 2 (Bob + 1 brother) - **Total siblings:** 4 sisters + 2 brothers = **6 siblings**  Finally, to find out how many brothers **Alice** has:  - Since there are **2 brothers** in total (Bob and his brother), and they are all siblings, **Alice has 2 brothers**.  ### Answer: 2",
