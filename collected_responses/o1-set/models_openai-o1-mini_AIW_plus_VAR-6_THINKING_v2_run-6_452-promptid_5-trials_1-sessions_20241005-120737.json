So, there are **6 cousins** from the mother's side.  3. **Father's Side:**    - **Paternal Uncle:** Father has 1 brother.    - **Uncle's Children:** The paternal uncle has 2 daughters.    - **Uncle's Nephews and Nieces:** The uncle has a total of 4 nephews and nieces. This includes his own 2 daughters plus 2 more from other siblings (assuming there are no additional brothers, this could imply that the father has another sibling with 2 children).    - **Cousins from Father's Side:** The 2 daughters of the paternal uncle are **2 cousins**.  4. **Total Cousins:**    - **From Mother's Side:** 6 cousins.    - **From Father's Side:** 2 cousins.    - **Total Cousins:** 6 + 2 = **8 cousins**.  ### Answer: 8",

Father's Side:** - Father has 1 brother (paternal uncle). - The uncle has 2 daughters. - The uncle has a total of 4 nephews and nieces. - Since the uncle's children are not counted as his nephews and nieces, the remaining 2 nephews and nieces come from the father\u2019s side (likely other siblings or additional children not specified).  **4. Total Cousins:** - From the mother's side: 6 cousins. - From the father's side: 4 cousins. - Total cousins: 6 (mother's side) + 4 (father's side) = 10 cousins.  ### Answer: 10",
