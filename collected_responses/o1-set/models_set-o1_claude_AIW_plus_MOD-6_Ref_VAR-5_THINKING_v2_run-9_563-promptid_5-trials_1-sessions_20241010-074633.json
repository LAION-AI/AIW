        "model_response":"To determine how many cousins Alice's sister has, let's break down the information step by step:  1. **Alice's Immediate Siblings:**    - Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother, making a total of 4 children in the family.  2. **Maternal Side:**    - **Mother's Siblings:**      - 2 brothers (maternal uncles).      - 1 sister (maternal aunt) who has no children.    - **Children from Maternal Uncles:**      - The 2 maternal uncles have a total of 6 children. Since the maternal aunt has no children, there are **6 cousins** from the maternal side.  3. **Paternal Side:**    - **Father's Siblings:**      - 2 sisters (paternal aunts).      - 1 brother (paternal uncle).    - **Children from Paternal Uncle:**      - The paternal uncle has 1 son.      - He also has 5 nephews and nieces in total. Since Alice's immediate family has 4 children, the paternal aunts must collectively have **1 child**.    - **Total Cousins from Paternal Side:**      - 1 child from the paternal aunts + 1 son from the paternal uncle = **2 cousins**. However, considering that the uncle's count includes these, the actual additional cousins from the aunts are **1**.  4. **Total Cousins:**    - **Maternal Side:** 6 cousins    - **Paternal Side:** 1 cousin    - **Total:** 6 + 1 = **7 cousins**  Therefore, Alice's sister has **7 cousins**.  ### Answer: 7",

Alice's mother's side:    * Alice's mother has 2 brothers.    * She also has 1 sister who does not have children.    * This sister has 6 nephews and nieces in total.    * Since Alice's mother's sister doesn't have children, the 6 nephews and nieces come from Alice's mother's 2 brothers.  3. Alice's father's side:    * Alice's father has 2 sisters.    * He also has a brother who has 5 nephews and nieces in total, and 1 son.    * The 5 nephews and nieces of Alice's father's brother include his own son, so he has 4 nephews and nieces from other siblings.  4. Calculating Alice's sister's cousins:    * From Alice's mother's side:      - The 6 nephews and nieces of Alice's mother's sister are Alice and her siblings.      - Therefore, Alice's sister has no cousins from her mother's side.    * From Alice's father's side:      - Alice's father's brother has 1 son, who is Alice's sister's cousin.      - The other 4 nephews and nieces of Alice's father's brother are also Alice's sister's cousins.      - Alice's father has 2 sisters, and their children are also Alice's sister's cousins.      - We don't know the exact number of children Alice's father's sisters have, but we can deduce that they have 4 children in total (based on the information that Alice's father's brother has 5 nephews and nieces, including his own son).  So, Alice's sister has: - 0 cousins from her mother's side - 1 cousin (son of her father's brother) - 4 cousins (children of her father's sisters)  In total, Alice's sister has 1 + 4 = 5 cousins.  Let's double-check the calculation: - The total number of nephews and nieces of Alice's father's brother (5) matches the sum of his own son (1) and the children of his siblings (4). - The total number of Alice's sister's cousins (5) matches the sum of her cousins from her father's side (1 + 4).

This includes Alice, her 3 siblings, and 2 more.    - Alice's father's brother has 5 nephews and nieces.      This includes Alice, her 3 siblings, and 1 more.  6. The additional nephews\/nieces must be the children of Alice's other aunts\/uncles:    - 2 from mother's side    - 1 from father's side  7. Therefore, Alice's cousins are:    - 2 from mother's side    - 1 + 1 = 2 from father's side (including the known son of her uncle)  8. Total number of Alice's cousins: 2 + 2 = 4  9. The question asks for the number of cousins Alice's sister has.    Since Alice and her sister are siblings, they have the same cousins.  Therefore, Alice's sister has 4 cousins.  ### Answer: 4",

First, let's identify Alice's immediate family:    - Alice    - 2 sisters of Alice    - 1 brother of Alice    So Alice's parents have 4 children in total.  2. Now, let's look at Alice's mother's side:    - Mother has 2 brothers    - Mother has 1 sister with no children  3. Alice's father's side:    - Father has 2 sisters    - Father has 1 brother who has 1 son  4. We need to find Alice's cousins. Cousins are the children of aunts and uncles.  5. From mother's side:    - Mother's sister has no children    - Mother's 2 brothers might have children, but we don't have direct information  6. From father's side:    - Father's 2 sisters might have children, but we don't have direct information    - Father's brother has 1 son, which is a cousin  7. We're told that mother's sister (who has no children) has 6 nephews and nieces in total. This must include Alice and her siblings (4) plus 2 more. These 2 must be from the mother's brothers.  8. We're also told that father's brother has 5 nephews and nieces in total. This must include Alice and her siblings (4) plus 1 more. This 1 must be from the father's sisters.  9. So, in total, we can count:    - 2 cousins from mother's side    - 1 cousin (the son) from father's brother    - 1 cousin from father's sisters  10. Therefore, the total number of cousins is 4.  11. The question asks for the number of cousins Alice's sister has, which would be the same as Alice's cousins.  ### Answer: 4",

On Alice's father's side:    - Alice's father has 2 sisters    - Alice's father has 1 brother    - This brother has 5 nephews and nieces in total    - This brother also has 1 son  4. To find Alice's sister's cousins, we need to count the children of Alice's aunts and uncles:    - On mother's side:       * 2 uncles, but we don't know how many children they have    - On father's side:      * 2 aunts, but we don't know how many children they have      * 1 uncle who has 1 son  5. The key information is:    - Alice's mother's sister has 6 nephews and nieces    - Alice's father's brother has 5 nephews and nieces  6. Since Alice and her siblings are 4 of these nephews and nieces, the remaining must be their cousins:    - On mother's side: 6 - 4 = 2 cousins    - On father's side: 5 - 4 = 1 cousin (which matches the information about the uncle's son)  7. Therefore, the total number of cousins is: 2 + 1 = 3  8. Since the question asks about Alice's sister's cousins, the answer remains the same, as siblings have the same cousins.  ### Answer: 3",
