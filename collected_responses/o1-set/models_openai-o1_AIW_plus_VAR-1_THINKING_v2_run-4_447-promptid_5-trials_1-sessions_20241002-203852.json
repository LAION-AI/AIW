        "model_response":"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of cousins Alice's sister has by analyzing both Alice's maternal and paternal sides of the family.  **Maternal Side:**  1. Alice's mother has:    - 1 sister (who is childless).    - 2 brothers (Alice's maternal uncles).     2. The childless sister has 6 nephews and nieces, who are the children of her siblings (Alice's mother and the two brothers).  3. Since Alice's mother has 3 daughters (Alice and her two sisters), and the total number of nephews and nieces is 6, the two brothers must have 3 children between them.  4. Therefore, on the maternal side, Alice's sister has **3 cousins** (the children of the two uncles).  **Paternal Side:**  1. Alice's father has:    - 1 brother, who has 2 daughters.    - At least one more sibling (possibly a sister) because the brother has 5 nephews and nieces (the children of his siblings).  2. Alice's father's brother's 5 nephews and nieces are:    - 3 from Alice's father (Alice and her two sisters).    - 2 from another sibling (Alice's aunt).  3. Therefore, on the paternal side, Alice's sister has **2 cousins** from her father's brother and **2 cousins** from the other sibling, totaling **4 cousins**.  **Total Cousins:**  Adding the maternal and paternal cousins together: - Maternal cousins: **3** - Paternal cousins: **4** - **Total cousins: 7**  ### Answer: 7",
