        "model_response":"Let's break down the problem step by step to determine how many cousins Alice's sister has.  1. **Alice and Her Siblings:**    - Alice has 4 sisters, making a total of 5 daughters in her immediate family.  2. **Mother's Side:**    - **Siblings of Alice's Mother:**      - 1 sister (maternal aunt) with no children.      - 2 brothers (maternal uncles).    - **Nephews and Nieces from Mother's Side:**      - The maternal aunt has 6 nephews and nieces.      - Since the maternal aunt has no children, these nephews and nieces must come from the mother's 2 brothers and herself.      - Alice and her 4 sisters are 5 nieces. Therefore, the 2 brothers together have 1 child (5 nieces + 1 child = 6 nephews and nieces).  3. **Father's Side:**    - **Sibling of Alice's Father:**      - 1 brother (paternal uncle) who has 1 son.    - **Nephews and Nieces from Father's Side:**      - The paternal uncle has 5 nephews and nieces.      - These include Alice and her 4 sisters (totaling 5 nieces).  4. **Total Cousins:**    - **From Mother's Side:** 1 cousin (from the 2 maternal uncles).    - **From Father's Side:** 1 cousin (from the paternal uncle's 1 son).    - **Total Cousins:** 1 (mother's side) + 1 (father's side) = 2 cousins.  ### Answer: 2",
