        "model_response":"Let's break down the problem step by step to determine how many cousins Alice's sister has.  1. **Alice's Immediate Siblings:**    - Alice has **3 sisters**, making a total of **4 daughters** in the family.  2. **Maternal Side:**    - **Alice's Mother** has **1 sister** (Alice's maternal aunt) who **does not have children**.    - However, this aunt has **7 nephews and nieces**, which must come from **Alice's mother's brothers**.    - **Alice's Mother** has **2 brothers** (Alice's maternal uncles).    - These **2 brothers have a total of 7 children** (Alice's cousins from the maternal side).  3. **Paternal Side:**    - **Alice's Father** has **1 brother** (Alice's paternal uncle).    - This paternal uncle has **1 son**.    - Additionally, the paternal uncle has **5 nephews and nieces**. These are Alice's siblings, as they are the children of Alice's father.    - Therefore, from the paternal side, the uncle's children include **1 son** and the **5 nephews and nieces** (which are Alice and her 3 sisters). However, there's an inconsistency here because Alice and her sisters account for **4 nephews and nieces**, but the uncle is said to have **5**. For the sake of this problem, we'll assume there's possibly an additional sibling not mentioned.  4. **Total Cousins:**    - From the **maternal side**, Alice's sister has **7 cousins**.    - From the **paternal side**, assuming the count is accurate, there are **5 cousins**.    - **Total cousins** = **7 (maternal) + 5 (paternal) = 12 cousins**.  ### Answer: Alice's sister has **12 cousins**.",
