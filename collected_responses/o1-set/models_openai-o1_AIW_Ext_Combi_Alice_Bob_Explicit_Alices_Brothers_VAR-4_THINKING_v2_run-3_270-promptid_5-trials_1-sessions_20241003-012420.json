So, the total number of siblings in the family is \\( 4 (\\text{females}) + 2 (\\text{males}) = 6 \\) children.  **Alice's brothers are:** - **Bob** - **Bob's brother**  Therefore, **Alice has 2 brothers**.  ### Answer: 2",

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's analyze the family step by step.  1. **Alice and Bob are siblings**: Alice (a sister) and Bob (a brother) are in the same family.  2. **Alice has 3 sisters**: This means, besides herself, there are 3 other sisters in the family. So, total sisters = 3 (her sisters) + 1 (Alice herself) = **4 sisters**.  3. **Bob has 1 brother**: This means there is one other brother besides Bob. So, total brothers = 1 (Bob's brother) + 1 (Bob himself) = **2 brothers**.  4. **Total siblings in the family**: 4 sisters + 2 brothers = **6 siblings**.  5. **Number of brothers Alice has**: Since the family has 2 brothers (Bob and his brother), and they are both Alice's brothers, Alice has **2 brothers**.  ### Answer: Alice has 2 brothers.",
