        "model_response":"Let's solve this problem step by step to determine the number of cousins Alice's sister has.  Given: - Alice has 1 sister and 3 brothers in total. - Alice's mother has 2 brothers. - Alice's mother has 1 sister who does not have children. - Alice's mother's sister has 4 nephews and 2 nieces in total. - Alice's father has 2 sisters. - Alice's father has a brother who has 3 nephews and 2 nieces in total, and who also has 1 daughter.  Step 1: Determine the number of cousins from Alice's mother's side. - Alice's mother's brothers' children are Alice's sister's cousins. - The number of cousins from this side is not explicitly given.  Step 2: Determine the number of cousins from Alice's father's side. - Alice's father's sisters' children are Alice's sister's cousins. - The number of cousins from this side is not explicitly given. - Alice's father's brother has 1 daughter, who is also Alice's sister's cousin. - Total cousins from Alice's father's side = Number of cousins from father's sisters + 1 (father's brother's daughter)  Step 3: Calculate the total number of cousins. Total cousins = Cousins from mother's side + Cousins from father's side  Now, let's double-check the given information to see if we can determine the number of cousins: - The information about Alice's mother's sister (4 nephews and 2 nieces) is irrelevant because she doesn't have children, so they are not Alice's sister's cousins. - The information about Alice's father's brother (3 nephews and 2 nieces) is also irrelevant because they are not necessarily Alice's sister's cousins. Only his daughter is counted as a cousin.  After analyzing the problem, we can conclude that there is not enough information to determine the exact number of cousins Alice's sister has. We only know that she has at least 1 cousin (Alice's father's brother's daughter), but the number of cousins from Alice's mother's brothers and Alice's father's sisters is unknown.  ### Answer: There is not enough information to determine the exact number of cousins Alice's sister has.",
