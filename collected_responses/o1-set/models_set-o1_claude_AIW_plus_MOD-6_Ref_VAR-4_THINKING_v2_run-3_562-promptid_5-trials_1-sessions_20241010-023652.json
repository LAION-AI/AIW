        "model_response":"Let's think through this step by step:  1. First, let's identify Alice's immediate family:    - Alice    - Alice's sister    - Alice's 3 brothers    - Alice's mother    - Alice's father  2. Now, let's look at Alice's mother's side:    - Alice's mother has 2 brothers    - Alice's mother has 1 sister (who has no children)  3. On Alice's father's side:    - Alice's father has 2 sisters    - Alice's father has 1 brother (who has 1 daughter)  4. To find Alice's sister's cousins, we need to count the children of Alice's aunts and uncles, excluding Alice and her siblings.  5. From Alice's mother's side:    - Her 2 uncles might have children, but we don't have information about them.    - Her aunt has no children.  6. From Alice's father's side:    - We know her uncle has 1 daughter (explicitly stated).    - We don't have information about children from her 2 aunts.  7. The tricky part is the information about nephews and nieces:    - Alice's mother's sister (aunt) has 6 nephews and nieces in total.    - Alice's father's brother (uncle) has 5 nephews and nieces in total.  8. We know Alice and her siblings are 5 in total (Alice, her sister, and 3 brothers).    This matches the number of nephews and nieces Alice's father's brother has.  9. The extra nephew\/niece on Alice's mother's side must be the daughter of Alice's father's brother.  10. Therefore, we can conclude that Alice's aunts on her father's side don't have children, as all nephews and nieces are accounted for.  11. The only cousin we can definitively identify is the daughter of Alice's father's brother.  Double-checking this reasoning, it seems consistent with all the information provided.  ### Answer: 1",

The 6 nephews\/nieces of mother's sister must include Alice and her siblings (5 in total), plus one more. This extra one must be a cousin from one of mother's brothers.  2. On father's side, his brother has 5 nephews\/nieces. These must be Alice and her 4 siblings. The brother also has 1 daughter, who is a cousin to Alice and her siblings.  3. We don't have specific information about children from father's two sisters, but we know they aren't included in the 5 nephews\/nieces mentioned for father's brother.

Now, Alice's father's side:    - Father has 2 sisters    - Father has 1 brother  5. We need to count the children of these aunts and uncles:    - Mother's 2 brothers: We don't know how many children they have    - Mother's sister: No children    - Father's 2 sisters: We don't know how many children they have    - Father's brother: We know he has 1 daughter  6. The key information is about Alice's father's brother:    - He has 5 nephews and nieces in total    - Alice and her siblings (1 sister + 3 brothers = 4 siblings) account for 4 of these    - The remaining 1 must be from the father's sisters' children  7.

        "model_response":"To determine the number of cousins Alice's sister has, we'll break down the family relationships step by step.  **Alice's Immediate Family:** - **Parents:** Alice's mother and father. - **Siblings:** Alice, her one sister, and three brothers \u2014 totaling five children.  **Alice's Sister's Nephews and Nieces:** - Alice's sister has no children but has **6 nephews and nieces**. These are the children of her siblings (excluding herself). - Therefore, **Alice and her three brothers have a total of 6 children** among them.  **Alice's Father's Side:** - **Siblings of Alice's Father:**   - **Two Sisters (Aunts):** No information is given about them having children. Given that the father's brother has a total of 5 nephews and nieces (who are Alice and her siblings), we can conclude these aunts have no children.   - **One Brother (Uncle):** He has **one daughter** (Alice's cousin).  **Alice's Father's Brother's Nephews and Nieces:** - The uncle has **5 nephews and nieces**, who are the children of his siblings. Since Alice's father has 5 children and the aunts have none (as deduced), these nephews and nieces are **Alice and her siblings**.  **Alice's Mother's Side:** - **Two Brothers (Maternal Uncles):** No information is provided about them having children. Given the specificity of the problem in mentioning children when they exist, we can infer that they **do not have children**.  **Conclusion:** - **Cousins from Father's Side:** Alice's sister has **one cousin**, the daughter of her paternal uncle. - **Cousins from Mother's Side:** None, as her maternal uncles have no children.  Therefore, Alice's sister has **one cousin**.  ### Answer: 1",
