        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of cousins that Alice's sister has, which is the same as the number of Alice's cousins.  **Maternal Side:** - Alice's mother has:   - 1 sister (who has no children).   - 2 brothers. - The childless sister has **6 nephews and nieces**. Since she has no children, these are the children of her siblings (Alice's mother and her two brothers). - Alice's mother has **3 daughters** (Alice and her two sisters). - Therefore, the two brothers together have **3 children** (since 6 - 3 = 3).  **Paternal Side:** - Alice's father has:   - 1 brother (who has **2 daughters**).   - At least one more sibling (since his brother has **5 nephews and nieces** in total). - The brother's 5 nephews and nieces are:   - Alice and her two sisters (**3 nieces**).   - The **2 children** of the other sibling (since 5 - 3 = 2).  **Total Cousins:** - On the maternal side: **3 cousins** (from the two maternal uncles). - On the paternal side: **4 cousins** (2 from the uncle's daughters and 2 from the other sibling's children). - **Total cousins:** 3 (maternal) + 4 (paternal) = **7 cousins**.  ### Answer: 7",
