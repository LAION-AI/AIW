        "model_response":"Let's think through this step-by-step:  1. First, we need to identify Alice's aunts and uncles:    - From her mother's side: 2 uncles and 1 aunt    - From her father's side: 2 aunts and 1 uncle     2. Now, let's count the children of these aunts and uncles:    - Mother's side:      * The aunt has no children (stated in the problem)      * We don't have information about the uncles' children    - Father's side:      * We don't have information about the two aunts' children      * The uncle has 2 sons (stated in the problem)  3. We know that Alice's father's brother (uncle) has 1 nephew and 4 nieces in total.    - The 1 nephew must be Alice's brother    - The 4 nieces must be Alice, her sister, and the two daughters of Alice's other paternal aunt  4. From this, we can deduce that:    - Alice's paternal uncle has 2 sons    - One of Alice's paternal aunts has 2 daughters    - The other paternal aunt has no children (as we've accounted for all the nieces)  5. On the maternal side, we know the aunt has no children, but we don't know about the uncles' children.  6. To find Alice's sister's cousins, we add up:    - 2 sons from the paternal uncle    - 2 daughters from one paternal aunt    - 0 from the other paternal aunt    - 0 from the maternal aunt    - Unknown number from the two maternal uncles  7. The total we can confirm is 4 cousins, but there could be more from the maternal uncles.  Therefore, Alice's sister has at least 4 cousins, but the exact number cannot be determined from the given information.  ### Answer: At least 4",

        "model_response":"Let's think through this step-by-step:  1. We need to count Alice's cousins, which would be the same number as Alice's sister's cousins.  2. Cousins come from aunts and uncles. Let's count them:    - From mother's side: 2 uncles and 1 aunt    - From father's side: 2 aunts and 1 uncle    Total: 6 aunts\/uncles  3. Now, let's count the children of these aunts\/uncles:     Mother's side:    - 2 uncles: We don't have information about their children    - 1 aunt: We're told she doesn't have children     Father's side:    - 2 aunts: We don't have information about their children    - 1 uncle: We're told he has 2 sons  4. The tricky part is the information about nephews and nieces:    - Mother's sister has 2 nephews and 4 nieces    - Father's brother has 1 nephew and 4 nieces  5. These nephews and nieces include Alice, her sister, and her brother. We need to subtract them:    - From mother's side: 2 nephews + 4 nieces - 3 (Alice, her sister, brother) = 3    - From father's side: 1 nephew + 4 nieces - 3 (Alice, her sister, brother) = 2  6. Adding these up: 3 + 2 = 5  7. We also know the father's brother has 2 sons, which we've already counted.  8. Double-checking: This matches with the 5 cousins we calculated from the nephew\/niece information.  Therefore, Alice's sister has 5 cousins.  ### Answer: 5",

        "model_response":"Let's think through this step-by-step:  1. First, let's identify Alice's immediate family:    - Alice has 1 sister and 1 brother    - So, Alice's parents have 3 children in total  2. Let's look at Alice's mother's side:    - Alice's mother has 2 brothers    - Alice's mother has 1 sister who has no children    - This sister has 2 nephews and 4 nieces in total    - These 2 nephews and 4 nieces must be Alice, her siblings, and her cousins from her mother's brothers  3. Let's look at Alice's father's side:    - Alice's father has 2 sisters    - Alice's father has 1 brother    - This brother has 1 nephew and 4 nieces in total    - This brother also has 2 sons  4. Now, let's count Alice's cousins:    - From mother's side:       * Mother has 2 brothers, but we don't know exactly how many children they have    - From father's side:      * Father's brother has 2 sons      * We don't know if father's sisters have any children  5. The key information is from Alice's father's brother:    - He has 1 nephew and 4 nieces in total    - We know 3 of these are Alice and her siblings (1 nephew, 2 nieces)    - So the remaining 2 nieces must be cousins from Alice's father's sisters  6. Therefore, Alice's cousins are:    - 2 sons from father's brother    - 2 daughters from father's sisters  7. The total number of cousins is 4  8. Since the question asks about Alice's sister's cousins, the answer remains the same, as siblings have the same cousins.  Double-checking this reasoning, it appears to be consistent with the given information.  ### Answer: 4",

Now, Alice's father's side:    - Alice's father has 2 sisters    - Alice's father has 1 brother  3. Let's count the cousins from mother's side:    - Mother's 2 brothers might have children, but we don't have information about them    - Mother's sister doesn't have children, so no cousins from her  4. Now, let's count the cousins from father's side:    - We don't have information about children of father's 2 sisters    - Father's brother has 2 sons  5. We know that Alice's father's brother has 1 nephew and 4 nieces in total:    - The 1 nephew is likely Alice's brother    - The 4 nieces likely include Alice, her sister, and possibly 2 more from the father's sisters  6. Similarly, Alice's mother's sister has 2 nephews and 4 nieces in total:    - The 2 nephews are likely Alice's brother and one of her cousins from her father's side    - The 4 nieces likely include Alice, her sister, and 2 more (matching with the information from father's side)  7. From this, we can deduce that Alice has 2 cousins:    - 2 sons of her father's brother  8. Alice's sister would have the same number of cousins as Alice.

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of cousins Alice's sister has, which is the same as the number of cousins Alice has.  **Step 1: Alice's Immediate Family** - Alice has 1 sister and 1 brother. So, there are 3 siblings in total. - Alice's sister has no children. - Alice's sister has 2 nephews and 4 nieces, which must be the children of Alice and their brother.   - Therefore, Alice and her brother have a total of 6 children (2 nephews + 4 nieces = 6 children).  **Step 2: Alice's Paternal Relatives** - Alice's father has:   - 2 sisters (Alice's aunts).   - 1 brother (Alice's uncle) who has 2 sons (Alice's cousins). - The father's brother has 1 nephew and 4 nieces, implying:   - The nephew is Alice's brother.   - The nieces are Alice, her sister, and the 2 daughters of the father's sisters.   - Therefore, the 2 sisters each have 1 daughter (Alice's cousins).  **Step 3: Alice's Maternal Relatives** - Alice's mother has 2 brothers. - There is no information provided about the children of these uncles.   - Without any specific information, we cannot assume they have children.  **Conclusion:** - Total cousins from father's side:   - 2 sons of father's brother: **2 male cousins**.   - 1 daughter from each of the 2 sisters: **2 female cousins**. - Total cousins from mother's side:   - **0 cousins** (due to lack of information).  **Final Answer:** Alice's sister has a total of **4 cousins**.  ### Answer: 4",
