Since she has no children, these nephews and nieces must be the children of her siblings. - The aunt also has **2 brothers**, so Alice's mother has a total of **3 siblings**: the childless sister and the 2 brothers. - The **6 nephews and nieces** are the children of Alice's mother and her two brothers.   - Alice's mother has **3** children (Alice and her 2 sisters).   - Therefore, the two maternal uncles must have **3** children between them (since 6 - 3 = 3).  On the paternal side:  - Alice's father has **a brother** who has **2 daughters**. - This brother (Alice's uncle) has **5 nephews and nieces**. These are his siblings' children. - Therefore, Alice's father must have at least **two siblings** (including the brother with 2 daughters). - Alice's father's children (Alice and her 2 sisters) account for **3** of the nephews and nieces. - The remaining **2** nephews and nieces must be the children of another sibling (Sibling X), thus Sibling X has **2** children.  Calculating cousins:  - **Maternal cousins**: 3 children from the two maternal uncles. - **Paternal cousins**: 2 daughters of Uncle, plus 2 children of Sibling X, totaling **4**.
