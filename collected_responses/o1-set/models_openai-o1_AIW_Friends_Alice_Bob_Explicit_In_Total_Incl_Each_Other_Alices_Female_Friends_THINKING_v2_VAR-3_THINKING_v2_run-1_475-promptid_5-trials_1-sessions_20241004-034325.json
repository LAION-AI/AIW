        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's start by understanding the given information:  1. **Alice has 3 male friends (including Bob).** 2. **Bob has 6 female friends (including Alice).** 3. **All mentioned persons are friends with each other and have no other friends outside this group.**  Let's deduce the group of people involved:  - **Alice (female)** - **Bob (male)** - **2 other males (since Alice has 3 male friends including Bob)** - **5 other females (since Bob has 6 female friends including Alice)**  So, the total group consists of **9 people**: 1 (Alice) + 1 (Bob) + 2 (other males) + 5 (other females).  Since all mentioned persons are friends with each other and have no other friends, everyone in this group is friends with everyone else.  Now, let's find out how many female friends Alice has:  - **Total females in the group: 6 (Alice + 5 other females)** - Since Alice is friends with all the other females (because everyone is friends with everyone else), she has **5 female friends**.  ### Answer: 5",
