        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many sisters Alice's brothers have. Let's break it down step by step.  1. **Determine the total number of sisters:**    - Alice has **3 sisters**. This number does not include Alice herself. Therefore, including Alice, there are **4 sisters** in total.  2. **Determine the siblings of Alice's brothers:**    - Alice's brothers share the same siblings as Alice. This includes the **2 brothers** (themselves) and the **4 sisters**.  3. **Find out how many sisters the brothers have:**    - Since each brother cannot be his own sister, each brother has **4 sisters**.  ### Answer: 4",
