        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we start by analyzing Alice's immediate family and then extend to her extended family on both her mother's and father's sides.  1. **Alice's Immediate Family**: Alice has 3 sisters, making them 4 siblings in total.  2. **Mother's Side**:     - Alice's mother has:         - 1 sister (who has no children).         - 2 brothers.     - The sister (Alice's aunt) has 6 nephews and nieces. These are the children of her siblings (Alice's mother and her two brothers).         - Alice's mother has 4 daughters (Alice and her sisters), contributing 4 nieces.         - Therefore, the two brothers together must have 2 children to make up the total of 6 nephews and nieces.     - So, on her mother's side, Alice has **2 cousins** (the children of her maternal uncles).  3. **Father's Side**:     - Alice's father has:         - 1 brother who has 1 son.     - This brother has 4 nephews and nieces. These are the children of his siblings.         - Alice's father has 4 daughters (Alice and her sisters), contributing 4 nieces.         - There are no other siblings mentioned, so all nephews and nieces come from Alice's father.     - So, on her father's side, Alice has **1 cousin** (the son of her paternal uncle).  4. **Total Cousins**:     - Adding the cousins from both sides: **2 (maternal cousins) + 1 (paternal cousin) = 3 cousins**.  ### Answer: 3",
