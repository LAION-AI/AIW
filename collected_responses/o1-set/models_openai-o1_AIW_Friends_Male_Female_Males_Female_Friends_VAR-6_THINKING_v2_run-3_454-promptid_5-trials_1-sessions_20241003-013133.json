        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the relationships described.  1. **Alice's Friends**: Alice has a total of 8 friends \u2014 5 female friends and 3 male friends.     2. **Friendship Among Alice's Friends**: All of Alice's friends are friends with each other. This means:    - Each of the 3 male friends is friends with the other 2 male friends.    - Each male friend is friends with all 5 female friends.    - All friends are friends with Alice herself.  3. **No Other Friends**: Alice's friends do not have any friends outside of this group.  Now, focusing on one of Alice's male friends:  - **Female Friends**: He is friends with:   - The 5 female friends of Alice.   - Alice herself (who is also female).  Therefore, the total number of female friends that a male friend of Alice has is **6** (the 5 female friends plus Alice).  ### Answer: 6",
