        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's carefully analyze the given information step by step:  1. **Total People Involved**:    - Alice.    - 3 male friends (let's call them M1, M2, M3).    - 6 female friends (let's call them F1 through F6).    - **Total**: 1 (Alice) + 3 (male friends) + 6 (female friends) = **10 people**.  2. **Friendship Relations**:    - **\"They all are friends with each other\"** implies that every person in this group is friends with every other person.    - This forms a **complete friendship network** among all 10 people.  3. **Friends of a Male Friend**:    - Let's consider one male friend, say **M1**.    - **M1's Friends**:      - **Alice** (since everyone is friends with each other).      - **M2 and M3** (the other two male friends).      - **F1 through F6** (the six female friends).    - **Total Friends of M1**: 9 (since there are 10 people in total, excluding himself).  4. **Number of Female Friends M1 Has**:    - **Female Friends**:      - **Alice** (female).      - **F1 through F6** (six female friends).      - **Total Female Friends**: **1 + 6 = 7**.  5. **Conclusion**:    - Therefore, each male friend of Alice has **7 female friends** within this group.  ### Answer: 7",
