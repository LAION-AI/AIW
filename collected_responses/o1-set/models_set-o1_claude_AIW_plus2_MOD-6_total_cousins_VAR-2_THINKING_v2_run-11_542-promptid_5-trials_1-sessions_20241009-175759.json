On Alice's father's side:    - Father has 2 sisters    - Father has 1 brother who has 1 son    - This uncle has 1 nephew and 3 nieces  4. To find Alice's sister's cousins, we need to count the children of Alice's aunts and uncles:    - Mother's side:       * 2 uncles, but we don't know if they have children    - Father's side:      * 2 aunts, but we don't know if they have children      * 1 uncle who has 1 son  5. The only cousin we can confirm is the son of Alice's paternal uncle.  6. We might be tempted to use the information about nephews and nieces, but this could lead to mistakes:    - The nephews and nieces mentioned for the maternal aunt include Alice and her siblings    - The nephews and nieces mentioned for the paternal uncle also include Alice and her siblings  7.

Double-checking: - We didn't use the information about the mother's sister's nephews and nieces, as it doesn't directly relate to Alice's cousins. - We also didn't use the information about Alice's father's brother's nephew and nieces, as this likely includes Alice and her siblings. - The only relevant information for cousins is the son of Alice's father's brother.

Alice's mother also has 1 sister who does not have children. This sister has 2 nephews and 4 nieces in total. These nephews and nieces are the children of Alice's mother's brothers (from step 2).

Again, we don't know how many children they have.  5. Alice's father also has a brother who has 1 nephew and 3 nieces in total. This brother also has 1 son.
