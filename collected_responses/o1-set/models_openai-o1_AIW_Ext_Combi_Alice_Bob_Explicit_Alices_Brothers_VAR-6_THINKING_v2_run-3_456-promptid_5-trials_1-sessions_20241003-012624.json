        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we'll logically determine the number of siblings in Alice and Bob's family.  1. **Alice's Sisters**: Alice has 3 sisters. This count does not include herself, so there are 4 girls in total (Alice plus her 3 sisters).  2. **Bob's Brothers**: Bob has 5 brothers. This count does not include himself, so there are 6 boys in total (Bob plus his 5 brothers).  3. **Total Siblings**: Combining the numbers, there are 4 girls and 6 boys, making a total of 10 siblings in the family.  4. **Alice's Brothers**: Since Alice is one of the 4 girls, the remaining siblings are her brothers.
