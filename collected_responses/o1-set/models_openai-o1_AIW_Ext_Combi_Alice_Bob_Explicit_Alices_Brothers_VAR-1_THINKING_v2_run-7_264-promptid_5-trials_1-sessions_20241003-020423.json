        "model_response":"To determine how many brothers Alice has, let's analyze the information step by step:  1. **Alice and Bob are siblings**: Alice and Bob are sister and brother, meaning they are part of the same family.  2. **Alice has 3 sisters**: This means that besides Alice herself, there are 3 other sisters in the family. So, the total number of girls in the family is \\( 1 (\\text{Alice}) + 3 (\\text{sisters}) = 4 \\) girls.  3. **Bob has 6 brothers**: This means that besides Bob himself, there are 6 other brothers in the family. So, the total number of boys in the family is \\( 1 (\\text{Bob}) + 6 (\\text{brothers}) = 7 \\) boys.  4. **Total siblings**: Combining the total number of boys and girls, the family has \\( 4 (\\text{girls}) + 7 (\\text{boys}) = 11 \\) children.  5. **Brothers of Alice**: Since Alice is one of the 4 girls, her brothers are all the boys in the family. Therefore, Alice has \\( 7 \\) brothers.  ### Answer: 7",

        "model_response":"To solve this problem carefully, let's break it down step by step:  1. **Determine the total number of daughters (including Alice):**    - Alice has **3 sisters**.    - Including herself, there are **4 daughters** in total.  2. **Determine the total number of sons (including Bob):**    - Bob has **6 brothers**.    - Including himself, there are **7 sons** in total.  3. **Calculate the total number of children in the family:**    - Total children = Total sons + Total daughters = **7 + 4 = 11** children.  4. **Find out how many brothers Alice has:**    - The brothers are the sons in the family (excluding the daughters).    - Since there are **7 sons**, and Alice is a daughter, she has **7 brothers**.  Therefore, **Alice has 7 brothers**.  ### Answer: 7",
