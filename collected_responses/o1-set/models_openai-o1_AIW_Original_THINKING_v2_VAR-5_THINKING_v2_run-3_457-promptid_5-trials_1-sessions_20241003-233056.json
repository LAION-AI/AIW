        "model_response":"To find out how many sisters Alice's brother has, let's break it down step by step:  1. **Total Sisters**: Alice has 3 sisters. Including Alice herself, there are 4 sisters in total. 2. **Total Brothers**: Alice has 2 brothers. 3. **Total Siblings**: Therefore, there are 4 sisters and 2 brothers, making 6 siblings in the family.  Now, focusing on **Alice's brother**:  - He has **1 brother** (since he wouldn't count himself) and **4 sisters** (the 4 girls in the family, including Alice).  So, **Alice's brother has 4 sisters**.  ### Answer: 4",

        "model_response":"To solve this problem:  1. **Determine the total number of sisters in the family, including Alice.**    - Alice has 3 sisters, and she herself is also a sister.    - Total sisters = 3 (Alice's sisters) + 1 (Alice) = **4 sisters**.  2. **Since Alice has two brothers, the total number of siblings is 4 sisters + 2 brothers = 6 children.**  3. **Identify how many sisters one of Alice's brothers has.**    - Each brother will have all the sisters in the family as his sisters.    - Therefore, each brother has **4 sisters**.  ### Answer: 4",
