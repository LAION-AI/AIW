        "model_response":"To determine how many cousins Alice's sister has, let's break down the information step by step:  1. **Alice's Immediate Family:**    - **Siblings:** Alice has 1 sister and 1 brother.    - **Children of Siblings:**       - The sister does not have children.      - Together, Alice and her brother have 6 children (6 nephews and nieces).  2. **Mother's Side:**    - **Uncles:** Alice's mother has 2 brothers.    - **Cousins from Mother's Brothers:** Assuming each uncle has children, but the exact number isn't specified. However, from the sister's perspective, all nephews and nieces (6) come from Alice and her brother, so the uncles' children aren't contributing additional cousins beyond these.  3. **Father's Side:**    - **Aunts and Uncles:** Alice's father has 2 sisters and 1 brother.    - **Children of Father's Brother:** He has 1 daughter and a total of 5 nephews and nieces. Since the father has 2 sisters, their children contribute to the cousin count. The brother's children (1 daughter) plus the nephews and nieces (5) suggest additional cousins.  4. **Total Cousins:**    - From Alice and her brother: 6 cousins.    - From father's side: 5 nephews and nieces.    - Total cousins = 6 (from siblings) + 5 (from father's brother) = **11**.  ### Answer: 11",

The children of these brothers would be Alice's sister's cousins. However, we don't know how many children they have.  3. Alice's mother also has 1 sister who does not have children. This sister has 6 nephews and nieces in total. Since Alice's mother's sister doesn't have children, these 6 nephews and nieces must come from Alice's mother's 2 brothers. Therefore, Alice's sister has 6 cousins from her mother's side.  4. Alice's father has 2 sisters. The children of these sisters would also be Alice's sister's cousins. However, we don't know how many children they have.  5. Alice's father also has a brother who has 5 nephews and nieces in total, and who also has 1 daughter. The 1 daughter is not counted in the 5 nephews and nieces. The 5 nephews and nieces must be Alice, her sister, and her brother, as well as the 2 children of Alice's father's sisters (since Alice's father's brother has only 1 daughter).

In total, Alice's sister has 6 cousins from her mother's side and 2 cousins from her father's side.  Double-checking the solution: - Alice's sister has 6 cousins from her mother's 2 brothers. - Alice's sister has 2 cousins from her father's 2 sisters. - In total, Alice's sister has 6 + 2 = 8 cousins.
