        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we need to carefully unpack the relationships described:  1. **Alice and Bob are friends**. Alice is female, and Bob is male. 2. **Alice has 3 male friends**. Since Bob is male and already established as Alice's friend, he is counted among these. Therefore, Alice has two other male friends besides Bob. 3. **Bob has 6 female friends**. Similarly, since Alice is female and Bob's friend, she is included in these 6. So, Bob has five other female friends besides Alice. 4. **All mentioned persons are friends with each other and have no other friends aside**. This means every person mentioned is friends with every other person, and they don't have any friends outside of this group.  Now, let's list out all the people:  - **Males**: Bob, Male Friend 1, Male Friend 2 (Total of 3 males) - **Females**: Alice, Female Friend 1, Female Friend 2, Female Friend 3, Female Friend 4, Female Friend 5 (Total of 6 females)  Since Alice is friends with everyone else, her female friends are the other females in the group:  - Alice's female friends: Female Friend 1, Female Friend 2, Female Friend 3, Female Friend 4, Female Friend 5  **Therefore, Alice has 5 female friends**.  ### Answer: 5",
