        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we have to carefully map out Alice's family tree based on the given information.  1. **Alice's Immediate Family**:    - Alice has **3 sisters**. So, in total, she is one of **4 siblings**.    - There is additional information from the paternal uncle's perspective. He has **5 nephews and nieces**. Since he only has one brother (Alice's father), those 5 nephews and nieces are all of Alice's father's children. Therefore, Alice must have **one brother** as well.    - So, Alice's immediate family consists of **5 children**: Alice, her 3 sisters, and 1 brother.  2. **Maternal Side**:    - **Alice's mother** has:      - **1 sister** (Alice's maternal aunt) who **does not have children**.      - **2 brothers** (Alice's maternal uncles).    - The maternal aunt has **6 nephews and nieces**, which are the children of her siblings (Alice's mother and the two brothers).     - Since Alice's mother has **5 children**, the two brothers must have **1 child in total** to make up the total of 6 nephews and nieces from the aunt's perspective.    - Therefore, on the maternal side, Alice has **1 cousin** (child of her maternal uncles).  3. **Paternal Side**:    - **Alice's father** has **1 brother** (Alice's paternal uncle).    - The paternal uncle has **5 nephews and nieces** (Alice and her siblings) and **1 son**.    - Therefore, Alice has **1 cousin** from her paternal uncle.  4. **Total Cousins**:    - **Maternal side**: **1 cousin**.    - **Paternal side**: **1 cousin**.    - Therefore, Alice's sister has **2 cousins** in total.  However, upon reviewing the numbers, there's a discrepancy. The initial calculation assumed the maternal uncles have 2 children, but based on the total nieces and nephews (6) and Alice's siblings (5), the uncles only have **1 child between them** (since 6 - 5 = 1). This means Alice has **1 cousin** on the maternal side, not 2.  Finally, the total number of cousins that Alice's sister has is **1 (maternal) + 1 (paternal) = 2 cousins**.  **Answer: 2**",

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's break down the family relationships step by step:  1. **Alice's Immediate Family:**    - Alice has **3 sisters**.    - From information given on the paternal side (below), we deduce that Alice also has **1 brother**, because her father's brother (Uncle) has **5 nephews and nieces**, which must come from Alice's father's children.    - **Total siblings for Alice:** 3 sisters + Alice + 1 brother = **5 children**.  2. **Maternal Side:**    - Alice's mother has:      - **1 sister** who is childless.      - **2 brothers**.    - The childless sister (Aunt) has **6 nephews and nieces**. These are the children of her siblings:      - Alice's mother's children: **5** (from point 1).      - The 2 brothers' (uncles') children: Therefore, they have **1 child** between them (since 5 + 1 = 6).  3. **Paternal Side:**    - Alice's father has:      - **1 brother** who has **1 son**.      - This brother (Uncle) has **5 nephews and nieces**:        - These are the children of his siblings. Since he only has one brother (Alice's father), all these nephews and nieces are Alice and her siblings.        - Therefore, Alice's father has **5 children** (which matches point 1).  4. **Total Cousins for Alice's Sister:**    - From maternal uncles: **1 cousin**.    - From paternal uncle: **1 cousin**.    - **Total cousins:** 1 + 1 = **2 cousins**.  ### Answer: 2",
