        "model_response":"First, let's understand the set of people involved:   - Alice - Bob - Alice's 3 male friends - Bob's 6 female friends  According to the problem, \"All mentioned persons are friends with each other and have no other friends aside.\" This means:  - Everyone mentioned knows everyone else in the group. - There are no additional friends outside this group.  Let's count how many female friends Alice has:  - **Bob's 6 female friends**: Since everyone is friends with each other, these 6 females are friends with Alice. - **Alice herself** is not counted as her own friend.  So, Alice has **6 female friends**, who are Bob's female friends.  ### Answer: 6",

        "model_response":"Based on the information provided, we can find the number of female friends Alice has by following these steps:  - Let \\( N \\) be the total number of people in the group.    - Since \"all mentioned persons are friends with each other,\" each person has \\( N - 1 \\) friends.  - Alice, being one of the females, has 3 male friends (given). Therefore, she has \\( (N - 1) - 3 \\) female friends.  - Bob, being one of the males, has 6 female friends (given). Therefore, he has \\( (N - 1) - 6 \\) male friends.  - The total number of males \\( m \\) is the number of male friends Bob can have plus himself: \\( m = [(N - 1) - 6] + 1 = N - 6 \\).  - The total number of females \\( f \\) is the number of female friends Alice can have plus herself: \\( f = [(N - 1) - 3] + 1 = N - 3 \\).  - Since the total number of people \\( N = m + f \\), substitute the expressions for \\( m \\) and \\( f \\):   \\[ N = (N - 6) + (N - 3) \\]   \\[ N = 2N - 9 \\]   \\[ N = 9 \\]  - Now calculate the number of females:   \\[ f = N - 3 = 9 - 3 = 6 \\]  - The number of female friends Alice has is \\( f - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5 \\) (excluding herself).  ### Answer: 5",

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's carefully consider all the people involved and the relationships between them.  - **Alice** and **Bob** are among the group. - Alice has **3 male friends**. - Bob has **6 female friends**. - **All mentioned persons are friends with each other** and have no other friends outside this group.  Since all mentioned persons are friends with each other, we can infer:  1. **Alice's male friends** include all the males in the group except her (since she is female). Therefore, the total number of males in the group must be **3** (the number of male friends of Alice).     2. **Bob's female friends** include all the females in the group except him (since he is male). Therefore, the total number of females in the group must be **6** (the number of female friends of Bob).  The group members are:  - **Males**: Bob, Male Friend 1, Male Friend 2 (Total of 3 males). - **Females**: Alice, Female Friend 1, Female Friend 2, Female Friend 3, Female Friend 4, Female Friend 5 (Total of 6 females).  Now, considering Alice's friends:  - She is friends with all the males (3 male friends). - She is friends with all the females except herself, so she has **5 female friends**.  Therefore, the number of female friends Alice has is **5**.  ### Answer: 5",

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we start by carefully interpreting the information given:  1. **Alice and Bob are friends**, and they have some other friends.  2. **Alice has 3 male friends**.  3. **Bob has 6 female friends**.  4. **All mentioned persons are friends with each other and have no other friends aside**.  Our goal is to find out **how many female friends Alice has**.  Let's define:  - Let's assume Alice's male friends include Bob. This means the total number of males in the group is the 3 male friends of Alice (including Bob).  - Similarly, Bob's female friends include Alice, so the total number of females is the 6 female friends of Bob (including Alice).  - Let **M** be the total number of males and **F** be the total number of females.  From the given information:  - **M = 3** (Alice's 3 male friends, including Bob) - **F = 6** (Bob's 6 female friends, including Alice)  Total number of people in the group is **N = M + F = 3 + 6 = 9**.  Since all persons are friends with each other, every person has **N - 1 = 8** friends.  Calculating Alice's female friends:  - Alice's total number of friends is **8**. - Alice already has **3 male friends**. - Therefore, the number of female friends Alice has is **8 (total friends) - 3 (male friends) = 5**.  ### Answer: 5",
