        "model_response":"To determine the number of cousins Alice's sister has, let's break down the information step by step:  1. **Alice's Immediate Family:**    - Alice has 4 sisters, making a total of 5 daughters in her immediate family.  2. **Mother's Side:**    - **Siblings of Alice's Mother:**      - 1 sister (aunt) who does not have children.      - 2 brothers (uncles).    - **Children from Mother's Brothers:**      - The aunt (who has no children) has 6 nephews and nieces. These are the children of her 2 brothers.      - Total cousins from the mother's side: **6**.  3. **Father's Side:**    - **Siblings of Alice's Father:**      - 1 brother (uncle).    - **Children from Father's Brother:**      - The uncle has 1 son.      - The uncle also has 5 nephews and nieces, which are Alice and her 4 sisters.      - Total cousins from the father's side: **1** (since Alice and her sisters are already part of the immediate family, only the uncle's son counts as a new cousin).  4. **Total Cousins:**    - **Mother's Side:** 6    - **Father's Side:** 1    - **Total:** 6 + 1 = **7**  ### Answer: 7",
