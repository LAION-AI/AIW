        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's analyze the family structure step by step.  1. **Understand the family relations:**    - Alice and Bob are siblings in the same family.    - Alice is a sister.    - Bob is a brother.  2. **Determine the number of sisters:**    - Alice has **3 sisters** besides herself. This means there are **4 sisters** in total (including Alice).  3. **Determine the number of brothers:**    - Bob has **5 brothers** besides himself. This means there are **6 brothers** in total (including Bob).  4. **Calculate the total number of children in the family:**    - Total children = Number of sisters + Number of brothers = **4 sisters + 6 brothers = 10 children**.  5. **Find out how many brothers Alice has:**    - Alice's brothers are all the male siblings in the family.    - Therefore, Alice has **6 brothers** (the same 6 brothers in the family).  ### Answer: 6",
