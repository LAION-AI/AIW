Alice's mother has:    - 2 brothers    - 1 sister (who has no children)  3. Alice's father has:    - 2 sisters    - 1 brother (who has 1 daughter)  4. We need to count the children of Alice's aunts and uncles, excluding Alice and her siblings.  5. From the mother's side:    - The mother's sister has no children    - We don't know if the mother's brothers have children  6. From the father's side:    - We know the father's brother has 1 daughter    - We don't know if the father's sisters have children  7. The key information is that Alice's father's brother has 5 nephews and nieces in total.     This includes Alice and her 2 siblings (3), plus his own daughter (1).    5 - 3 - 1 = 1    This means there must be 1 more cousin from one of the father's sisters.  8. So, we can count the cousins:    - 1 from father's brother    - 1 from father's sister    - Total: 2 cousins  9. Double-checking: This aligns with the information that the father's brother has 5 nephews and nieces (3 from Alice's family + 1 his own daughter + 1 from his sister = 5)  Therefore, Alice's sister has 2 cousins.  ### Answer: 2",

Since Alice's mother's sister doesn't have children, these 6 nephews and nieces must come from Alice's mother's 2 brothers. Therefore, Alice's sister has 6 cousins from her mother's side.  4. Alice's father has 2 sisters. We don't know how many children they have, so we can't count their children as cousins yet.  5. Alice's father has a brother who has 5 nephews and nieces in total, and who also has 1 daughter. The 1 daughter is Alice's sister's cousin. The remaining 4 nephews and nieces must be Alice, her sister, and her brother. Therefore, Alice's sister has 1 cousin from her father's side.  Double-checking the solution: - Alice's sister has 6 cousins from her mother's side (step 3). - Alice's sister has 1 cousin from her father's side (step 5). - In total, Alice's sister has 6 + 1 = 7 cousins.  ### Answer: Alice's sister has 7 cousins.",

        "model_response":"Let's break down the problem and solve it step by step:  1. Alice's family:    * Alice has 1 sister and 1 brother.    * Alice's sister has the same number of cousins as Alice.  2. Alice's mother's side:    * Alice's mother has 2 brothers.    * Alice's mother has 1 sister who doesn't have children.    * The sister has 6 nephews and nieces in total.    * Since Alice's mother's sister doesn't have children, the 6 nephews and nieces must be from Alice's mother's 2 brothers.    * Therefore, Alice has 6 cousins from her mother's side.  3. Alice's father's side:    * Alice's father has 2 sisters.    * Alice's father has 1 brother.    * The brother has 5 nephews and nieces in total.    * The brother also has 1 daughter.    * The 5 nephews and nieces include the brother's own daughter, so the remaining 4 must be Alice and her siblings.    * Therefore, Alice's father's 2 sisters have a total of 4 children (nephews and nieces of Alice's father's brother).    * Alice has 4 cousins from her father's side.  4. Total number of cousins:    * Alice has 6 cousins from her mother's side and 4 cousins from her father's side.    * In total, Alice has 6 + 4 = 10 cousins.  Double-checking the solution: * The number of cousins from Alice's mother's side (6) is consistent with the given information. * The number of cousins from Alice's father's side (4) is also consistent with the given information. * The total number of cousins (10) is the sum of the cousins from both sides.  Therefore, the solution is correct.  ### Answer: Alice's sister has 10 cousins.",

The number of children these brothers have is not specified, so we can't determine how many cousins Alice has from her mother's side.  3. Alice's mother also has 1 sister who does not have children. This sister has 6 nephews and nieces in total. Since Alice's mother has 3 children, the other 3 nephews and nieces must come from the 2 brothers mentioned in step 2.  4. Alice's father has 2 sisters.

        "model_response":"Let's approach this problem step by step to determine the number of cousins Alice's sister has.  Given: - Alice has 1 sister and 1 brother. - Alice's mother has 2 brothers. - Alice's mother has 1 sister who does not have children and has 6 nephews and nieces in total. - Alice's father has 2 sisters. - Alice's father has a brother who has 5 nephews and nieces in total and 1 daughter.  Step 1: Determine the number of cousins Alice has from her mother's side. - Alice's mother's brothers' children are Alice's cousins. - The total number of nephews and nieces of Alice's mother's sister is 6, which includes Alice, her sister, and her brother. - So, the number of cousins from Alice's mother's brothers is 6 - 3 = 3.  Step 2: Determine the number of cousins Alice has from her father's side. - Alice's father's sisters' children and his brother's daughter are Alice's cousins. - The total number of nephews and nieces of Alice's father's brother is 5, which includes Alice, her sister, and her brother. - So, the number of cousins from Alice's father's brother is 5 - 3 = 2. - Alice's father's sisters' children are also her cousins, but the number is not given.  Step 3: Determine the total number of cousins Alice has. - The total number of cousins Alice has is the sum of cousins from her mother's side and her father's side. - From her mother's side, Alice has 3 cousins. - From her father's side, Alice has at least 2 cousins from her father's brother, plus an unknown number of cousins from her father's sisters.  Step 4: Determine the number of cousins Alice's sister has. - Alice's sister has the same number of cousins as Alice.  Double-checking the solution: - The given information is correctly used to determine the number of cousins from Alice's mother's side and father's side. - The unknown number of cousins from Alice's father's sisters does not affect the minimum number of cousins Alice and her sister have.  ### Answer: Alice's sister has at least 5 cousins, with an additional unknown number of cousins from her father's sisters.",

This implies that **Alice and Brother B** collectively have **6 children** (since Sister A doesn't have any).  3. **Alice's Mother's Side:**    - Alice's **mother has 2 brothers (maternal uncles)**.
