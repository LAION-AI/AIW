These are the children of his siblings, which include Alice and her two sisters (3) plus potentially another child from another sibling, totaling 4. - Additionally, Uncle F has 2 daughters of his own, who are also Alice's cousins from the father's side.  **4. Total Cousins:** - From the mother's side: 6 cousins. - From the father's side: 4 nephews and nieces + 2 daughters = 6 cousins. - **Total cousins:** 6 (mother's side) + 6 (father's side) = **12 cousins**.  ### Answer: 12",
