        "model_response":"To determine how many brothers Alice has, let's analyze the information step by step:  1. **Siblings Breakdown:**    - **Alice's Side:** Alice has 2 sisters. This means there are 3 girls in total (Alice + 2 sisters).    - **Bob's Side:** Bob has 3 brothers. This means there are 4 boys in total (Bob + 3 brothers).  2. **Total Siblings:**    - Combining both sides, there are 3 females and 4 males, making a total of 7 siblings.  3. **Alice's Brothers:**    - Since there are 4 boys in the family (including Bob), Alice has 3 brothers.  ### Answer: 3",
