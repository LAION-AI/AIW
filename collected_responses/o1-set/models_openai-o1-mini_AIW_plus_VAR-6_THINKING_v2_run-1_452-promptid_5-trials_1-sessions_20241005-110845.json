        "model_response":"Let's break down the problem step by step to determine how many cousins Alice's sister has.  1. **Alice's Immediate Family:**    - **Alice** has **2 sisters**, making a total of **3 siblings** (Alice and her two sisters).  2. **Mother's Side of the Family:**    - **Alice's mother** has **1 sister** (Alice's maternal aunt) who **does not have children**.    - The aunt has **6 nephews and nieces**. Since she doesn't have children, these nephews and nieces must be Alice and her sisters' siblings from her brothers.    - Additionally, **Alice's mother** has **2 brothers**.    - Therefore, the **mother's side** contributes **6 cousins** (from the two uncles).  3. **Father's Side of the Family:**    - **Alice's father** has **1 brother** (Alice's paternal uncle).    - This uncle has **4 nephews and nieces** in total.    - The uncle also has **2 daughters**.    - Therefore, the **father's side** contributes **4 cousins** (from the uncle).  4. **Total Cousins:**    - **Mother's side:** 6 cousins    - **Father's side:** 4 cousins    - **Total cousins:** 6 + 4 = **10**  ### Answer: 10",
