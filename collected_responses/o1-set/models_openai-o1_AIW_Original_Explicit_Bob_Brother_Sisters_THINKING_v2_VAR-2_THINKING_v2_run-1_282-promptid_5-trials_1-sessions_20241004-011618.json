        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's carefully analyze the information provided:  1. **Alice has 2 sisters and 4 brothers.**    - This means Alice has 2 sisters *in addition to herself*. So, there are **3 girls in total** (Alice plus her 2 sisters).    - She has 4 brothers, so there are **4 boys** in the family.  2. **Total number of children in the family:**    - Total children = Number of girls + Number of boys = 3 (girls) + 4 (boys) = **7 children**.  3. **Bob is a brother of Alice.**    - Therefore, Bob is one of the 4 brothers.  4. **Number of sisters Bob has:**    - Bob's sisters are the same as Alice's sisters.    - Since there are 3 girls (Alice and her 2 sisters), Bob has **3 sisters**.  ### Answer: 3",
