        "model_response":"The key to solving this problem is carefully analyzing the family relationships and the information given.  1. **Alice's Siblings**:    - Alice has **3 sisters**, so there are **4 sisters in total** (including Alice herself).  2. **Maternal Side**:    - **Alice's Mother** has:      - **1 sister** who **does not have children**.      - **2 brothers**.    - The sister (Alice's aunt) has **6 nephews and nieces**. Since she doesn't have children, these must be the children of her siblings (Alice's mother and her two brothers).    - **Total nieces and nephews** for the aunt = **6**.    - **Alice's mother** has **4 daughters** (Alice and her 3 sisters).    - Therefore, the **two brothers together have 2 children** (6 total nieces and nephews - 4 from Alice's mother = 2 from the brothers).    - **Cousins from maternal side** = **2**.  3. **Paternal Side**:    - **Alice's Father** has:      - **1 brother** who has **1 son**.      - The brother (Alice's uncle) has **4 nephews and nieces**.

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's carefully unravel the family relationships step by step:  **Alice's Immediate Family:** - Alice has **3 sisters**, so there are 4 siblings in total (Alice plus her 3 sisters).  **Maternal Side:** 1. **Alice's Mother** has:    - **1 sister (Aunt #1)** who **does not have children**.    - **2 brothers (Uncle #1 and Uncle #2)**.   2. **Aunt #1** (who has no children) has **6 nephews and nieces**. These are the children of her siblings (since she has none of her own). Therefore:    - Alice's mother has **4 children** (Alice and her 3 sisters).    - This means **Uncle #1 and Uncle #2** together have **2 children** (since 6 - 4 = 2).  3.

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we'll carefully construct Alice's family tree based on the information provided and calculate the number of cousins her sister has.  **Step 1: Understand Alice's Immediate Family**  - Alice has **3 sisters**. So, in total, there are **4 daughters** in Alice's immediate family. - The problem doesn't mention any brothers for Alice, but this will be clarified later.  **Step 2: Explore Alice's Mother's Side**  - Alice's mother has:   - **1 sister** who **does not have children**.   - **2 brothers**. - The sister has **6 nephews and nieces**. Since she has no children, these must come from her siblings. - So, the total number of children that Alice's mother and her two brothers have is **6**.  Since Alice's mother has **4 daughters** (Alice and her 3 sisters), the remaining **2 nephews\/nieces** come from her brothers. Therefore, the brothers have a total of **2 children** between them.  **Step 3: Explore Alice's Father's Side**  - Alice's father has:   - **1 brother** who has **1 son**.   - This brother has **4 nephews and nieces**. - These nephews and nieces are Alice and her siblings. - Since the uncle has **4 nephews and nieces** and we know that Alice's parents have **4 children**, there is no indication of additional siblings.   **Step 4: Determine If Alice Has Brothers**  - On the father's side, the uncle has **4 nephews and nieces**. Since Alice and her 3 sisters make up **4 nieces**, and there are no nephews mentioned, it suggests that Alice has **no brothers**. - Therefore, Alice's immediate family consists of **4 daughters** only.  **Step 5: Calculate the Total Number of Cousins**  - **On the mother's side**:   - The two brothers have **2 children** in total. - **On the father's side**:   - The brother (Alice's uncle) has **1 son**. - Therefore, the total number of cousins is **2 (mother's side) + 1 (father's side) = 3 cousins**.  ### Answer: 3",
