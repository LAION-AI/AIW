        "model_response":"First, we analyze the family relationships step by step:  1. **Alice's Immediate Family**:    - Alice has 3 sisters. This means there are at least 4 children in Alice's family (Alice and her 3 sisters).    - The problem does not mention brothers, but we will consider whether there might be more siblings based on further information.  2. **Mother's Side**:    - Alice's mother has:      - 1 sister (who has no children).      - 2 brothers.    - The childless sister has 6 nephews and nieces. These are the children of her siblings (since she has no children herself).    - Alice's mother has at least 4 children (Alice and her sisters). Therefore, the 6 nephews and nieces include these 4 children.    - This means the two brothers (Alice's uncles) have a combined total of \\(6 - 4 = 2\\) children.    - These 2 children are Alice's cousins on her mother's side.  3. **Father's Side**:    - Alice's father has:      - 1 brother who has 1 son.      - This brother has 5 nephews and nieces, who must be the children of Alice's father.    - Since the brother has 5 nephews and nieces, Alice's father must have 5 children.    - We already know about Alice and her 3 sisters; thus, there must be \\(5 - 4 = 1\\) more sibling \u2014 possibly a brother.    - However, the problem focuses on Alice's sisters, so we can deduce that Alice has another sibling not previously mentioned.    - The brother's son is Alice's cousin on her father's side.  4. **Total Cousins**:    - Alice (and her sisters) have:      - 2 cousins from her mother's side.      - 1 cousin from her father's side.    - In total, Alice's sisters have \\(2 + 1 = 3\\) cousins.  ### Answer: 3",

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's piece together the family tree step by step.  1. **Alice's Immediate Family**:    - Alice has **3 sisters**, so there are **4 siblings** (including Alice) in her immediate family.    - Earlier, it might have seemed that Alice has no brothers, but there's room for more siblings as the problem unfolds.  2. **Maternal Side**:    - Alice's **mother** has:      - **1 sister** (Alice's aunt) who is **childless**.      - **2 brothers** (Alice's uncles).    - The **childless aunt** has **6 nephews and nieces**.      - These nephews and nieces are the children of her siblings (Alice's mother and her two brothers).    - Since Alice's mother has **4 children** (Alice and her 3 sisters), the two maternal uncles must have **2 children** between them (because 6 total nephews and nieces minus 4 from Alice's mother equals 2).  3. **Paternal Side**:    - Alice's **father** has **1 brother** (Alice's uncle).    - This uncle has **1 son**.    - The uncle has **5 nephews and nieces**, who are the children of his siblings.      - Since only Alice's father is mentioned as his sibling, Alice's father must have **5 children** so that his brother has 5 nephews and nieces.    - Alice's family already has **4 daughters**, so there must be an additional **sibling** (likely a brother) to make up the 5 nephews and nieces.  4. **Calculating Cousins**:    - **Maternal Cousins**:      - **2 cousins** from the two maternal uncles.    - **Paternal Cousins**:      - **1 cousin** from the paternal uncle.    - **Total Cousins**:      - **2 (maternal) + 1 (paternal) = 3 cousins**.
