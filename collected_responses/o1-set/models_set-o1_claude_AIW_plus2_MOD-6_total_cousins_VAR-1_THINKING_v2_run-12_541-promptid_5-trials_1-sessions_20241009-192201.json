First, let's identify Alice's aunts and uncles:    - From her mother's side: 2 uncles and 1 aunt    - From her father's side: 2 aunts and 1 uncle     2. Now, let's consider which of these aunts and uncles have children (Alice's cousins):    - Mother's side:      - We know the aunt doesn't have children      - We don't have information about the uncles' children    - Father's side:      - We know one uncle has 2 sons      - We don't have information about the aunts' children  3. Let's count the known cousins:    - 2 sons from father's brother  4. Now, let's look at the information about nephews and nieces:    - Mother's sister has 2 nephews and 4 nieces    - Father's brother has 1 nephew and 4 nieces  5. Here's where we need to be careful:    - The nephews and nieces mentioned could include Alice, her siblings, and her cousins    - We know Alice has 1 sister and 1 brother (3 children in total)  6. Father's brother's perspective:    - He has 1 nephew and 4 nieces = 5 in total    - We know he has 2 sons of his own    - So, 5 - 2 = 3, which matches Alice and her siblings  7. Mother's sister's perspective:    - She has 2 nephews and 4 nieces = 6 in total    - We know about Alice and her siblings (3)    - The other 3 must be cousins from the mother's side  8. Conclusion:    - Cousins from mother's side: 3    - Cousins from father's side: 2    - Total cousins: 3 + 2 = 5  Therefore, Alice's sister has 5 cousins.  ### Answer: 5",

From Alice's mother's side:    - Mother has 2 brothers    - Mother has 1 sister, but she doesn't have children  4. From Alice's father's side:    - Father has 2 sisters    - Father has 1 brother  5.

Therefore, the answer is correct.  ### Answer: Alice's sister has 13 cousins.",

Alice's mother has 1 sister who does not have children.    - This sister has 2 nephews and 4 nieces in total.    - Alice, her sister, and her brother account for 2 nieces and 1 nephew.    - So, there must be 1 more nephew and 2 more nieces from another sibling of Alice's mother. 4.
