Alice's mother has 1 sister who does not have children.    - This sister has 2 nephews and 4 nieces in total.    - Since Alice's mother's sister doesn't have children, these 2 nephews and 4 nieces must be Alice, her sister, and her brother. 4.

Now, let's count the total number of cousins Alice has:    - From her mother's side: 2 nephews + 4 nieces = 6 cousins    - From her father's side: 2 nephews + 2 nieces = 4 cousins    - Total cousins: 6 + 4 = 10  7.

Let's look at Alice's mother's side:    - Her mother has 2 brothers    - Her mother has 1 sister with no children    - The sister has 2 nephews and 4 nieces (6 in total)    - These 6 must be Alice, her siblings, and her cousins from her mother's brothers  3.

        "model_response":"Let's think through this step by step:  1. First, let's identify Alice's aunts and uncles:    - From her mother's side: 2 uncles and 1 aunt    - From her father's side: 2 aunts and 1 uncle    Total: 3 uncles and 3 aunts  2. Now, let's look at the information about children:    - Alice's mother's sister has no children    - Alice's father's brother has 1 daughter  3. We need to find how many cousins Alice's sister has. Alice's sister's cousins would be the children of Alice's aunts and uncles.  4. We know that:    - Alice's father's brother has 1 daughter (1 cousin)    - Alice's mother's sister has no children (0 cousins)  5. We don't have direct information about the children of the other aunts and uncles, but we can deduce it:    - Alice's father's brother has 3 nephews and 2 nieces in total    - We know 1 of these is his daughter    - The other 4 must be his siblings' children (Alice and her siblings)  6. So, Alice, her sister, and her brother account for 3 of these nephews\/nieces    The remaining 1 must be a child of Alice's father's other sister  7. Therefore, Alice's sister has:    - 1 cousin from her father's brother    - 1 cousin from her father's sister    - 0 cousins from her mother's sister    - We don't know about any cousins from her mother's brothers  8. The total number of confirmed cousins is 2  9. Double-checking: This answer seems consistent with the given information, although it's possible there could be more cousins from the mother's brothers that we don't have information about.  ### Answer: 2",

First, we need to identify Alice's aunts and uncles:    - From her mother's side: 2 uncles and 1 aunt    - From her father's side: 2 aunts and 1 uncle  2. Now, let's count the children of these aunts and uncles:    - Mother's side:      * The aunt has no children (stated in the problem)      * We don't have information about the uncles' children    - Father's side:      * We don't have information about the aunts' children      * The uncle has 1 daughter (stated in the problem)  3. We know that Alice's father's brother (uncle) has 3 nephews and 2 nieces in total:    - These nephews and nieces include Alice, her sister, and her brother    - So, 3 of these 5 children are Alice and her siblings  4. This means that there are 2 other children who are Alice's cousins from her father's side (in addition to the uncle's daughter we already know about)  5. So, we can count Alice's cousins:    - 1 daughter of father's brother    - 2 other cousins from father's side    - 0 cousins from mother's side (we know her aunt has no children, and no information is given about her uncles' children)  6. In total, that's 1 + 2 + 0 = 3 cousins  7. The question asks about Alice's sister's cousins, which would be the same as Alice's cousins.  Therefore, the final answer is:  ### Answer: 3",

The key information is about Alice's father's brother:    - He has 3 nephews and 2 nieces in total    - He has 1 daughter  4. Let's break down the nephews and nieces:    - Alice and her siblings account for 3 of these (Alice, her sister, and her brother)    - That leaves 2 more cousins (to make up the total of 5 nephews\/nieces)  5. So, Alice's father's brother has:    - 1 daughter (Alice's cousin)    - 2 other children who are Alice's cousins  6. In total, we can confirm 3 cousins for Alice's sister:    - 1 daughter of father's brother    - 2 other children of father's brother  7. Double-checking:    - We don't have information about other potential cousins from the other aunts and uncles    - The information given only allows us to confirm these 3 cousins  Therefore, based on the information provided, we can confirm that Alice's sister has at least 3 cousins.  ### Answer: 3",
