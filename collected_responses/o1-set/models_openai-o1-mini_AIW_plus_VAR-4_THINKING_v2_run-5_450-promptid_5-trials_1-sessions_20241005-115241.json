        "model_response":"To determine the number of cousins Alice's sister has, let's analyze the family relationships step by step:  1. **Alice and Her Sisters:**    - Alice has 4 sisters, making a total of 5 daughters in her immediate family.  2. **Mother's Side:**    - Alice's mother has one sister (a maternal aunt) who has no children.    - This maternal aunt has 6 nephews and nieces. Since she has no children of her own, these nephews and nieces must come from her siblings.    - Alice\u2019s mother has 2 brothers. Together with Alice and her 4 sisters (5 children), the total nephews and nieces count to 6. This implies that the two uncles have a combined total of **1 child**.  3. **Father's Side:**    - Alice's father has one brother (a paternal uncle) who has:      - 5 nephews and nieces. These are Alice and her 4 sisters.      - 1 son of his own.    - This means that from the father's side, there is **1 cousin** (the uncle's son).  4. **Total Cousins:**    - From the mother's side: 1 cousin.    - From the father's side: 1 cousin.    - **Total cousins:** 1 (mother's side) + 1 (father's side) = **2 cousins**.  ### Answer: 2",
