        "model_response":"Let's think through this step by step:  1. First, let's identify Alice's siblings:    - Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother    - So, there are 4 children in Alice's immediate family (including Alice)  2. Now, let's look at Alice's mother's side:    - Her mother has 2 brothers and 1 sister    - The sister doesn't have children    - The sister has 6 nephews and nieces in total  3. Let's examine Alice's father's side:    - Her father has 2 sisters and 1 brother    - The brother has 5 nephews and nieces in total    - The brother has 1 son  4. To find Alice's cousins, we need to count the children of her aunts and uncles:    - On mother's side: We know the aunt has no children, but we don't know about the uncles' children    - On father's side: We know one uncle has 1 son, but we don't know about the aunts' children  5. We can deduce the number of cousins from the information about nephews and nieces:    - Mother's sister has 6 nephews and nieces: These are Alice and her 3 siblings    - Father's brother has 5 nephews and nieces: These are Alice and her 3 siblings, plus his own son  6. This means that Alice's parents' siblings don't have any other children besides the ones we've accounted for  7. Therefore, Alice's only cousin is her father's brother's son  8.

The 6 nephews and nieces of Alice's mother's sister must include:    - Alice and her 3 siblings (4 in total)    - The remaining 2 must be children of Alice's mother's brothers  9. The 5 nephews and nieces of Alice's father's brother must include:    - Alice and her 3 siblings (4 in total)    - The remaining 1 must be a child of one of Alice's father's sisters  10.

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's carefully reconstruct Alice's family tree and compute the number of cousins her sister has.  **Alice's Immediate Family:** - **Parents:** Alice's mother and father. - **Siblings:** Alice, two sisters (one of whom does not have children), and one brother (total of 4 children).  **Information about Alice's Sister:** - The sister who does not have children has **6 nephews and nieces**. - **Conclusion:** Since she has no children, her nephews and nieces must be the children of her siblings. Therefore, Alice, her other sister, and brother have a combined total of **6 children**.  **Maternal Side (Mother's Family):** - **Mother's Siblings:** Two brothers and one sister who does not have children. - **Childless Aunt:** The mother's sister has **6 nephews and nieces**, meaning the combined children of the mother's other siblings (including Alice's mother). - **Conclusion:** Since Alice's mother has **4 children** (Alice and her siblings), the two maternal uncles must have a combined total of **2 children** (because \\(6 \\text{ nephews and nieces} - 4 \\text{ from Alice's family} = 2\\)).  **Paternal Side (Father's Family):** - **Father's Siblings:** Two sisters and one brother. - **Uncle's Information:** The father's brother has **5 nephews and nieces** and **1 son**. - **Conclusion on Nephews\/Nieces:** The uncle's nephews and nieces are the children of his siblings. Since Alice's father has **4 children**, and the uncle has **5 nephews and nieces**, the two paternal aunts must have **1 child** combined (because \\(5 \\text{ nephews and nieces} - 4 \\text{ from Alice's family} = 1\\)). - **Conclusion on Cousins:** The uncle has **1 son**, and there is **1 child** from the paternal aunts.  **Total Cousins for Alice's Sister:** - **Maternal Cousins:** \\(2\\) (from the maternal uncles). - **Paternal Cousins:** \\(1\\) (uncle's son) \\(+\\) \\(1\\) (from paternal aunts) \\(=\\) \\(2\\). - **Total Cousins:** \\(2 \\text{ (maternal)} + 2 \\text{ (paternal)} = 4\\)  ### Answer: 4",

        "model_response":"Let's solve this problem step by step to determine the number of cousins Alice's sister has.  Given: - Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother. - Alice's mother has 2 brothers. - Alice's mother has 1 sister who does not have children and has 6 nephews and nieces in total. - Alice's father has 2 sisters. - Alice's father has a brother who has 5 nephews and nieces in total and 1 son.  Step 1: Determine the number of cousins from Alice's mother's side. - Alice's mother has 2 brothers, and their children would be Alice's cousins. - The total number of nephews and nieces for Alice's mother's sister is 6, which includes Alice, her 2 sisters, and her brother. - Therefore, the number of cousins from Alice's mother's side is 0.  Step 2: Determine the number of cousins from Alice's father's side. - Alice's father has 2 sisters, and their children would be Alice's cousins. - The number of cousins from these 2 sisters is unknown. - Alice's father's brother has 1 son, who is Alice's cousin. - The total number of nephews and nieces for Alice's father's brother is 5, which includes Alice, her 2 sisters, and her brother, along with the brother's own son. - Therefore, the number of cousins from Alice's father's side is 1 (the son of Alice's father's brother).  Step 3: Calculate the total number of cousins Alice's sister has. - Alice's sister has the same number of cousins as Alice. - The total number of cousins is the sum of cousins from Alice's mother's side and Alice's father's side. - Total number of cousins = Cousins from mother's side + Cousins from father's side - Total number of cousins = 0 + 1 = 1  Double-checking the solution: - The given information does not provide the number of children Alice's father's sisters have, so we cannot include them in the calculation. - The calculation of cousins from Alice's mother's side and father's side is correct based on the given information.  ### Answer: Alice's sister has 1 cousin.",

Alice's mother's side:    - Alice's mother has 2 brothers.    - She also has 1 sister who does not have children.    - This sister has 6 nephews and nieces in total.    - Since Alice's mother's sister doesn't have children, the 6 nephews and nieces come from Alice's mother's 2 brothers.  3.
