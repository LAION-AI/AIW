        "model_response":"Let's think through this step-by-step:  1. First, we need to identify Alice's aunts and uncles:    - From her mother's side: 2 uncles and 1 aunt    - From her father's side: 2 aunts and 1 uncle  2. Now, let's count the children of these aunts and uncles:    - Mother's side:      * The aunt has no children (mentioned in the problem)      * The 2 uncles are not specified, so we can't count their children yet     - Father's side:      * One uncle has 1 son (mentioned in the problem)      * The 2 aunts are not specified, so we can't count their children yet  3. We're told that Alice's mother's sister (aunt) has 6 nephews and nieces in total.    These 6 must include:    - Alice    - Alice's 2 sisters    - Alice's 1 brother    - The 1 son of Alice's father's brother  4. This accounts for all 6 nephews and nieces mentioned, which means Alice's mother's brothers (uncles) don't have any children.  5. We're also told that Alice's father's brother (uncle) has 5 nephews and nieces in total.    These 5 must be:    - Alice    - Alice's 2 sisters    - Alice's 1 brother    - And there's no one else left, so Alice's father's sisters (aunts) don't have children  6. Now we can count Alice's cousins:    - From mother's side: 0 (her uncles don't have children)    - From father's side: 1 (her uncle's son)  7. The question asks for the number of cousins Alice's sister has, which would be the same as Alice's cousins.  Therefore, Alice's sister has 1 cousin.  ### Answer: 1",

Alice's mother's side:    - Mother has 2 brothers    - Mother has 1 sister (who doesn't have children)    The sister has 6 nephews and nieces. This matches the 4 children from Alice's family, plus 2 more.    So, each of mother's brothers likely has 1 child.  3. Alice's father's side:    - Father has 2 sisters    - Father has 1 brother    The brother has 5 nephews and nieces (4 from Alice's family, plus his own son)    The brother has 1 son  4. Counting Alice's cousins:    - From mother's side: 2 (1 child from each of mother's brothers)    - From father's side: 1 (the son of father's brother)  5. Double-checking:    - We've accounted for all mentioned family members    - The numbers of nephews and nieces match up with the information given    - We haven't counted any children of father's sisters, as no information was given about them  6. Conclusion:    Alice has 3 cousins in total (2 from mother's side, 1 from father's side)  7. The question asks about Alice's sister's cousins:    Alice's sister would have the same cousins as Alice  Therefore, Alice's sister has 3 cousins.  ### Answer: 3",

On the father's side:    - The brother has 5 nephews and nieces (Alice and her 3 siblings, plus 1 more)    - We know this brother has 1 son, which accounts for that extra nephew\/niece  7.

So, the total number of children of Alice's uncles on her mother's side is 6.  4. Alice's father has 2 sisters. These sisters are Alice's aunts, and their children would be Alice's cousins.  5. Alice's father also has a brother who has 5 nephews and nieces in total, and who also has 1 son. The brother's son is counted among the 5 nephews and nieces. These nephews and nieces are the children of Alice and her siblings (from step 1). So, the total number of children of Alice's aunts on her father's side is 5 minus the number of Alice's siblings, which is 5 - 3 = 2.  6. Now, to find the number of cousins Alice's sister has, we need to add the number of children of Alice's uncles on her mother's side (from step 3) and the number of children of Alice's aunts on her father's side (from step 5).     Total cousins = Children of uncles on mother's side + Children of aunts on father's side                  = 6 + 2                  = 8  Double-checking the solution: - The number of cousins from Alice's mother's side (6) is correct based on the given information. - The number of cousins from Alice's father's side (2) is also correct, as we subtracted Alice and her siblings from the total number of nephews and nieces mentioned. - The final addition of these two numbers (6 + 2 = 8) is correct.  Therefore, the solution appears to be correct.  ### Answer: Alice's sister has 8 cousins.",

Alice's mother's side:    - Alice's mother has 2 brothers.    - Alice's mother also has 1 sister who does not have children.    - This sister has 6 nephews and nieces in total.    - Since Alice's mother's sister doesn't have children, the 6 nephews and nieces must come from the 2 brothers and Alice's immediate family.    - We know that Alice's immediate family accounts for 4 of these 6 nephews and nieces.    - Therefore, the remaining 2 nephews and nieces must come from Alice's mother's 2 brothers.  3.

Given: - Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother. - Alice's mother has 2 brothers. - Alice's mother has 1 sister who does not have children and has 6 nephews and nieces in total. - Alice's father has 2 sisters. - Alice's father has a brother who has 5 nephews and nieces in total and 1 son.  Step 1: Determine the number of cousins from Alice's mother's side. - Alice's mother has 2 brothers, but the number of their children is not mentioned. - Alice's mother's sister has no children, so she does not contribute to the number of cousins. - The total number of nephews and nieces of Alice's mother's sister is 6, which includes Alice, her 2 sisters, and her brother. - Therefore, we cannot determine the exact number of cousins from Alice's mother's side.  Step 2: Determine the number of cousins from Alice's father's side. - Alice's father has 2 sisters, but the number of their children is not mentioned. - Alice's father's brother has 1 son, who is a cousin to Alice and her siblings. - The total number of nephews and nieces of Alice's father's brother is 5, which includes Alice, her 2 sisters, and her brother, along with his own son. - Therefore, we can confirm that Alice and her siblings have 1 cousin from their father's brother.
