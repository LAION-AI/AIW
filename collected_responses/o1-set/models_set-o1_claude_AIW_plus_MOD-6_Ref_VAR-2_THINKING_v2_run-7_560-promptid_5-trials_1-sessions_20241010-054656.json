        "model_response":"Let's approach this problem step by step to ensure we arrive at the correct answer.  Given: - Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother in total. - Alice's mother has 2 brothers. - Alice's mother has 1 sister who does not have children and who has 6 nephews and nieces in total. - Alice's father has 2 sisters. - Alice's father has a brother who has 4 nephews and nieces in total, and who also has 1 son.  Step 1: Determine the number of cousins from Alice's mother's side. - Alice's mother has 2 brothers, and their children will be Alice's cousins. - Since Alice's mother's sister does not have children, she does not contribute to the number of cousins. - The total number of nephews and nieces (6) includes Alice and her siblings, so we need to subtract them from the total. Number of cousins from Alice's mother's side = 6 - (2 sisters + 1 brother) = 6 - 3 = 3 cousins  Step 2: Determine the number of cousins from Alice's father's side. - Alice's father has 2 sisters, and their children will be Alice's cousins. - Alice's father's brother has 1 son, who is also Alice's cousin. - The total number of nephews and nieces (4) includes Alice and her siblings, so we need to subtract them from the total. Number of cousins from Alice's father's side = (4 - (2 sisters + 1 brother)) + 1 son = (4 - 3) + 1 = 2 cousins  Step 3: Calculate the total number of cousins Alice has. Total number of Alice's cousins = Cousins from mother's side + Cousins from father's side Total number of Alice's cousins = 3 + 2 = 5 cousins  Step 4: Since Alice's sister has the same cousins as Alice, the answer remains the same.  Double-checking the solution: - The given information is used correctly. - The calculations are accurate. - The final answer is consistent with the problem statement.  ### Answer: Alice's sister has 5 cousins.",

Alice's Maternal Side:**  - Alice's mother has **2 brothers** and **1 sister** who **does not have children**. - This childless sister (Alice's aunt) has **6 nephews and nieces**. - Since she has no children, her nephews and nieces are the children of her siblings (Alice's mother and her 2 brothers). - Alice's mother has **4 children** (Alice and her siblings). - Therefore, the **2 brothers** must have a combined total of **2 children** (since 4 children from Alice's mother + 2 children from her brothers = 6 nieces and nephews).  **3. Alice's Paternal Side:**  - Alice's father has **2 sisters** and **1 brother**. - The brother has **1 son** and **4 nephews and nieces**. - The nephews and nieces of Alice's father's brother are the children of his siblings (Alice's father and his 2 sisters). - Since Alice's father has **4 children** (Alice and her siblings), and the brother has **4 nephews and nieces**, the **2 sisters** must have **no children**.  **4. Counting Alice's Cousins:**  - **Maternal Cousins:** The children of Alice's mother's siblings are the **2 children** from her brothers. - **Paternal Cousins:** The children of Alice's father's siblings are the **1 son** of his brother. - **Total Cousins:** **2 (maternal)** + **1 (paternal)** = **3 cousins**.  ### Answer: 3",

This implies that the other sisters and the brother collectively have 6 children.  2. **Mother's Side:**    - **Maternal Uncles:** Alice's mother has 2 brothers. The number of children they have is not specified, so we don\u2019t have information about cousins from the maternal side.  3. **Father's Side:**    - **Paternal Aunts and Uncles:** Alice's father has 2 sisters (aunts) and 1 brother (uncle).    - **Uncle's Children:** The uncle has 1 son and a total of 4 nephews and nieces. This indicates that the aunts collectively have 3 children (since 1 uncle's son + 3 from aunts = 4 nephews and nieces).  4. **Calculating Cousins:**    - **From Father's Side:** The uncle contributes 1 cousin, and the aunts contribute 3 cousins, totaling 4 cousins from the paternal side.    - **From Mother's Side:** Information is insufficient to account for any cousins.  Since there\u2019s no information about the maternal uncles' children, we can only account for the 4 cousins from the paternal side.  ### Answer: 4",
