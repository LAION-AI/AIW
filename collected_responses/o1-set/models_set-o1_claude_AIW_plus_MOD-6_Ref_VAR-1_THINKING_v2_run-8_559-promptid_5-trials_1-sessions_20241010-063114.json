Alice's mother's side:    - Alice's mother has 2 brothers.    - Alice's mother also has 1 sister who does not have children.    - This sister has 6 nephews and nieces in total.      * These 6 nephews and nieces are Alice, her sister, her brother, and the children of her mother's 2 brothers.      * Since Alice's mother's sister doesn't have children, the remaining 3 nephews and nieces must be the children of Alice's mother's 2 brothers.  3. Alice's father's side:    - Alice's father has 2 sisters.    - Alice's father also has a brother who has 5 nephews and nieces in total.      * These 5 nephews and nieces are Alice, her sister, her brother, and the 2 sons of Alice's father's brother.    - Alice's father's brother has 2 sons.  4.

        "model_response":"Let's think through this step-by-step:  1. Alice has 1 sister and 1 brother. This means Alice's parents have 3 children in total.  2. Alice's mother has:    - 2 brothers    - 1 sister (who has no children)  3. Alice's father has:    - 2 sisters    - 1 brother (who has 2 sons)  4. We need to count the children of Alice's aunts and uncles, excluding Alice and her siblings:     From mother's side:    - Mother's 2 brothers: We don't know how many children they have.    - Mother's sister: Has no children.     From father's side:    - Father's 2 sisters: We don't know how many children they have.    - Father's brother: Has 2 sons.  5. We're told that the mother's sister (who has no children) has 6 nephews and nieces in total. This includes:    - Alice and her 2 siblings (3)    - Children of mother's 2 brothers (unknown, let's call it x)    So: 3 + x = 6    x = 3  6.

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's first map out Alice's family tree step by step.  **Alice's Immediate Family:** - Alice has:   - 1 sister   - 1 brother - So, Alice's parents have 3 children in total.  **Maternal Side:** - Alice's mother has:   - 2 brothers (Maternal Uncles)   - 1 sister who has no children. - The childless sister has 6 nephews and nieces in total. These are the children of her siblings (since she has no children). - Alice's mother has 3 children (Alice and her siblings). - Therefore, the two maternal uncles must have a total of 3 children (6 nephews and nieces minus Alice's mother's 3 children).  **Paternal Side:** - Alice's father has:   - 2 sisters (Paternal Aunts)   - 1 brother who has 2 sons. - The brother (paternal uncle) has 5 nephews and nieces, who are the children of his siblings. - Alice's father has 3 children (Alice and her siblings). - Therefore, the two paternal aunts must have a total of 2 children (5 nephews and nieces minus Alice's father's 3 children).  **Calculating Cousins:** - Cousins are the children of one's parents' siblings. - **Maternal Cousins:**   - Children of the two maternal uncles: 3 cousins. - **Paternal Cousins:**   - Children of the paternal brother: 2 cousins.   - Children of the two paternal aunts: 2 cousins. - **Total Cousins:**   - Maternal cousins (3) + Paternal cousins (2+2) = 7 cousins.  ### Answer: 7",
