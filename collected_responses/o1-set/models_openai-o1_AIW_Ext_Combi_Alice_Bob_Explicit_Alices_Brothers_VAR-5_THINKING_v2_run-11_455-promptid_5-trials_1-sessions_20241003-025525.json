        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we'll carefully analyze the information given:  1. **Alice and Bob are sister and brother**, which means they are siblings in the same family.  2. **Alice has 2 sisters**:    - This means Alice has two sisters *besides herself*.    - Including Alice, there are **3 sisters** in total.  3. **Bob has 3 brothers**:    - This means Bob has three brothers *besides himself*.    - Including Bob, there are **4 brothers** in total.  4. Now, we can determine the total number of siblings in the family:    - **Total sisters**: 3    - **Total brothers**: 4    - **Total children**: 3 sisters + 4 brothers = **7 siblings**  5. **Finding how many brothers Alice has**:    - Since there are 4 brothers in total, and they are all siblings in the same family, Alice has **4 brothers**.  ### Answer: 4",
