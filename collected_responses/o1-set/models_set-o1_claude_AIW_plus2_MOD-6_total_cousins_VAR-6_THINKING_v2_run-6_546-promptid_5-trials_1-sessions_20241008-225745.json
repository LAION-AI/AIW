First, we need to identify Alice's aunts and uncles:    - From her mother's side: 2 uncles and 1 aunt    - From her father's side: 2 aunts and 1 uncle  2. Now, we need to determine which of these aunts and uncles have children, as these children would be Alice's cousins:     - Mother's side:      - The 2 uncles: We don't have information about their children      - The 1 aunt: We're told she doesn't have children     - Father's side:      - The 2 aunts: We don't have information about their children      - The 1 uncle: We're told he has 1 daughter  3. We're also given information about nephews and nieces:    - Mother's sister has 2 nephews and 4 nieces    - Father's brother has 3 nephews and 2 nieces  4. The key insight is that Alice, her sister, and her brother are among these nephews and nieces:    - They account for 2 nieces (Alice and her sister) and 1 nephew (her brother) for both the mother's sister and the father's brother  5. So, the remaining nephews and nieces must be Alice's cousins:    - From mother's side: 1 nephew (2 - 1) and 2 nieces (4 - 2) = 3 cousins    - From father's side: 2 nephews (3 - 1) and 0 nieces (2 - 2) = 2 cousins    - Plus the 1 daughter of father's brother we know about  6. Adding these up: 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 cousins  7. The question asks about Alice's sister's cousins, which would be the same as Alice's cousins.

Now, let's count the cousins:        From mother's side:    - Mother's sister has no children, so no cousins from here    - Mother's 2 brothers: We don't have direct information about their children        From father's side:    - Father's 2 sisters: We don't have direct information about their children    - Father's brother has 1 daughter, so that's 1 cousin  5.

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cousins Alice's sister has, which is the same as the number of Alice's cousins. We'll break down the information provided to build the family tree step by step.  **Alice's Immediate Family:** - Alice has 1 sister and 1 brother. - So, Alice's parents have 3 children: Alice, her sister, and her brother.  **Maternal Side:** - Alice's mother has 2 brothers and 1 sister. - The sister (Alice's aunt) has no children but has 2 nephews and 4 nieces (total of 6 nephews and nieces). - These nephews and nieces are the children of Alice's mother and her two brothers since the sister has no children.  **Calculating Maternal Cousins:** - Alice's mother has 3 children (Alice, her sister, and brother). This accounts for 1 nephew and 2 nieces from the perspective of the childless aunt. - The total nephews and nieces are 2 nephews and 4 nieces, so the two brothers must have 1 nephew and 2 nieces collectively. - Therefore, Alice has 1 male cousin and 2 female cousins on her maternal side.  **Paternal Side:** - Alice's father has 2 sisters and 1 brother. - The brother (Alice's uncle) has 1 daughter. - This uncle also has 3 nephews and 2 nieces, who are the children of Alice's father and his two sisters. - From the uncle's perspective, Alice's family contributes 1 nephew and 2 nieces (Alice, her sister, and brother). - The two sisters must have 2 sons collectively to account for the remaining nephews. - Therefore, Alice has 2 male cousins and 1 female cousin on her paternal side.  **Total Cousins:** - Maternal cousins: 1 male, 2 female. - Paternal cousins: 2 male, 1 female. - Total cousins: 3 male, 3 female = **6 cousins**.  ### Answer: 6",
