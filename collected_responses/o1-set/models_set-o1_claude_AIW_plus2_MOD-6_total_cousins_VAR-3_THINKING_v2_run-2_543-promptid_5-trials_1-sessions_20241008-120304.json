There is no information about whether they have children, so we'll assume they have none unless stated otherwise.  3. **Alice's Father's Family:**    - **Paternal Aunts:** Alice's father has 2 sisters (PA1 and PA2).    - **Paternal Uncle:** Alice's father has 1 brother (PU1).    - **PU1's Children:**      - PU1 has 1 son.      - PU1 has 1 nephew and 4 nieces from his siblings (which include Alice's parents). This implies that from Alice and her siblings, there are 1 son and 4 daughters who are PU1's nephews and nieces.  4. **Alice's Siblings' Children:**    - **Given:** One of Alice's sisters (S1) does not have children but has 3 nephews and 4 nieces in total. These nephews and nieces come from Alice, S2, and B1.    - Therefore, Alice, S2, and B1 have a combined total of 7 children: 3 nephews and 4 nieces.  5. **Calculating Cousins:**    - **From Father's Side:**      - PU1 has 1 son.      - PU1 has 1 nephew and 4 nieces from Alice's family.      - Total from PU1 and his direct line: 1 (PU1's son) + 5 (nephews and nieces) = 6 cousins.    - **From Mother's Side:**      - No children are mentioned for MU1 and MU2, so we assume there are none unless specified.  6. **Final Count:**    - Total cousins come from the father's side: **6 cousins**.  ### Answer: 6",

The mother's sister's information (3 nephews and 4 nieces) must include additional children from the mother's brothers.  10. To get from 1 nephew (Alice's brother) to 3 nephews, the mother's brothers must have 2 sons in total.  11. The number of nieces stays at 4, which means no additional girls.

Now, let's look at the children of these aunts and uncles:    - Mother's sister: No children    - Father's brother: 1 son    - We don't have information about the children of the other aunts and uncles  3. We know that Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother, so that's 3 siblings in total.  4. Alice's mother's sister (aunt) has 3 nephews and 4 nieces in total:    - We know 3 of these are Alice and her siblings    - This means there must be 4 other cousins from her mother's side  5.

Here's the key insight: The nephews and nieces mentioned are likely Alice, her siblings, and her cousins.  7. From the father's brother's perspective:    - 1 nephew (Alice's brother)    - 4 nieces (Alice and her 2 sisters, plus 1 more)  8.

Alice's mother's side:    * Alice's mother has 2 brothers.    * Alice's mother also has 1 sister who does not have children.    * The sister has 3 nephews and 4 nieces in total.    * These 3 nephews and 4 nieces are Alice and her siblings (2 sisters and 1 brother).  3. Alice's father's side:    * Alice's father has 2 sisters.    * Alice's father also has a brother.    * The brother has 1 nephew and 4 nieces in total.    * The brother also has 1 son.    * The 1 nephew and 4 nieces are Alice and her siblings (2 sisters and 1 brother).  4. Counting Alice's cousins:    * From Alice's father's brother, there is 1 cousin (the son).    * The problem does not mention any children of Alice's father's sisters, so we assume they don't have any children.    * The problem also does not mention any children of Alice's mother's brothers, so we assume they don't have any children either.  5. Therefore, Alice has only 1 cousin (her father's brother's son).  Double-checking the solution: * The given information is consistent regarding Alice's siblings (2 sisters and 1 brother) from both her mother's sister's and father's brother's perspectives. * No other cousins are mentioned in the problem, so assuming only the explicitly stated cousin (father's brother's son) is correct.  ### Answer: Alice's sister has 1 cousin.",

However, the number of these cousins is not provided in the problem.  3. Alice's mother has 1 sister who does not have children. This sister has 3 nephews and 4 nieces in total. These nephews and nieces are Alice's cousins. So, from her mother's side, Alice has 3 + 4 = 7 cousins.  4. Alice's father has 2 sisters. The children of these sisters would be Alice's cousins. However, the number of these cousins is not provided in the problem.  5. Alice's father has a brother who has 1 nephew and 4 nieces in total, and who also has 1 son. The nephew and nieces are not Alice's cousins, as they are the cousins of Alice's father's brother's son. The son of Alice's father's brother, however, is Alice's cousin.
