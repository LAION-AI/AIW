Let's look at Alice's mother's side:    - Her mother has 2 brothers    - Her mother has 1 sister with no children    - The sister has 6 nephews and nieces in total  3. Now, Alice's father's side:    - Her father has 2 sisters    - Her father has 1 brother    - This brother has 5 nephews and nieces and 1 daughter  4. To find Alice's sister's cousins, we need to count the children of Alice's aunts and uncles, excluding Alice and her siblings:     From mother's side:    - 2 uncles: We don't know how many children they have        From father's side:    - 2 aunts: We don't know how many children they have    - 1 uncle: We know he has 1 daughter  5. The key information is in the number of nephews and nieces:    - Mother's sister has 6 nephews and nieces    - Father's brother has 5 nephews and nieces  6. We know Alice and her siblings account for 3 of these nephews and nieces on both sides.  7. So, on mother's side: 6 - 3 = 3 cousins    On father's side: 5 - 3 = 2 cousins  8. Total cousins: 3 + 2 = 5  9. Double-checking: This matches with the information given and accounts for all known children of Alice's aunts and uncles.  ### Answer: 5",

The only definite information we have about cousins is the 1 daughter of Alice's paternal uncle.  6. We might be tempted to use the information about nephews and nieces, but this could lead to incorrect assumptions:    - The 6 nephews and nieces of Alice's maternal aunt include Alice and her siblings    - The 5 nephews and nieces of Alice's paternal uncle also include Alice and her siblings  7. Therefore, we can only be certain about 1 cousin - the daughter of Alice's paternal uncle.  Double-checking this reasoning, we confirm that there's not enough information to determine any other cousins with certainty.  ### Answer: 1",
