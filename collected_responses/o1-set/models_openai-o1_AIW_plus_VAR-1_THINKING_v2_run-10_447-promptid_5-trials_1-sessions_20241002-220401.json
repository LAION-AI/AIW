        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many first cousins Alice's sister has. First cousins are the children of one's aunts and uncles.  Let's break down the family relationships step by step:  **1. Alice's Immediate Family:** - Alice has 2 sisters, so there are 3 daughters in her family (including Alice). - The problem mentions only sisters; there's no mention of brothers. However, for the numbers to add up (as explained below), we must consider that there are no brothers unless specified.  **2. On Alice's Mother's Side:** - Alice's mother has:   - 1 sister (who has no children).   - 2 brothers. - The childless sister has 6 nephews and nieces. Since she has no children, these are the children of her siblings (Alice's mother and her two brothers). - Alice's mother has 3 children (Alice and her 2 sisters). - Therefore, the 2 brothers combined must have 3 children (since 6 nephews and nieces - 3 from Alice's family = 3 from the brothers). - So, on her mother's side, Alice's sister has **3 cousins** (children of the two maternal uncles).  **3. On Alice's Father's Side:** - Alice's father has a brother who:   - Has 2 daughters (Alice's cousins).   - Has 5 nephews and nieces in total. - These 5 nephews and nieces are his brother's (Alice's father's) children and any other siblings' children. - Since the problem doesn't mention any other siblings of Alice's father, we can assume he only has the one brother. - Alice's father must have 3 children (Alice and her 2 sisters), matching the niece\/nephew count (since there are 5 nephews and nieces and 2 are the daughters of Alice's father's brother, the remaining 3 must be Alice and her sisters). - On her father's side, Alice's sister has **2 cousins** (the daughters of her paternal uncle).  **4. Total Number of Cousins:** - Adding up the cousins from both sides:   - Maternal cousins: 3   - Paternal cousins: 2   - **Total cousins: 3 + 2 = 5**  ### Answer: 5",

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of cousins that Alice's sister has by carefully analyzing the given family relationships step by step.  **Maternal Side Analysis:**  1. **Alice's Mother\u2019s Siblings:**    - **1 sister (the aunt):** She has no children.    - **2 brothers (maternal uncles):** Number of children unknown.     2. **The Aunt's Nephews and Nieces:**    - The aunt has 6 nephews and nieces.    - These are the children of her siblings: Alice's mother and her two brothers.    - Therefore, the total number of children from Alice's mother and her brothers is **6**.  3. **Alice's Mother's Children:**    - Alice has **2 sisters**. However, it's not specified whether she has brothers.    - Let's assume Alice has **no brothers** (since none are mentioned).    - Therefore, Alice's mother has **3 children** (Alice and her two sisters).  4. **Children of the Maternal Uncles:**    - Total children from Alice's mother and brothers: **6**.    - Children from Alice's mother: **3**.    - Therefore, the maternal uncles have **3 children** between them (since 6 - 3 = 3).    - Thus, Alice and her sisters have **3 cousins** on their mother's side.  **Paternal Side Analysis:**  1. **Alice's Father\u2019s Siblings:**    - **1 brother (the uncle):** He has **2 daughters**.    - It's implied that Alice's father has at least one other sibling since the uncle has **5 nephews and nieces**, which cannot be accounted for by Alice and her sisters alone if they are only 3.  2. **The Uncle's Nephews and Nieces:**    - The uncle has **5 nephews and nieces**, who are the children of his siblings.    - This suggests there is **another sibling** of Alice's father with children.  3. **Possible Family Scenario:**    - Alice's parents have **3 children** (Alice and her sisters).    - Alice's father's other sibling (possibly a sister) has **2 children**.    - Therefore, the uncle's nephews and nieces are Alice, her two sisters, and the two children of the other sibling, totaling **5**.  4. **Children from Paternal Side:**    - Uncle\u2019s children: **2 daughters** (Alice's cousins).    - Other sibling's children: **2** (Alice's cousins).    - Therefore, Alice and her sisters have **4 cousins** on their father's side.  **Total Number of Cousins:**  - **Maternal Side:** **3 cousins** - **Paternal Side:** **4 cousins**  **Grand Total:** **3 (maternal) + 4 (paternal) = 7 cousins**  **Answer: 7**",

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's carefully build Alice's family tree based on the given information.  **Alice's Immediate Family:** - Alice has 2 sisters. So, Alice's parents have at least 3 daughters: Alice and her 2 sisters.  **Paternal Side (Father's Family):** - Alice's father has **1 brother (Uncle1)**. - Uncle1 has **5 nephews and nieces in total**. - Uncle1 also has **2 daughters**.  Since Uncle1 has 5 nephews and nieces, and only Alice's father is mentioned as his sibling, those nephews and nieces must be all of Alice's father's children. Therefore, Alice's father has **5 children** (since Uncle1's only sibling is Alice's father). We already know of 3 daughters (Alice and her 2 sisters), so there must be **2 more siblings** (either brothers or sisters). This means Alice has **2 additional siblings** not previously mentioned.  **Maternal Side (Mother's Family):** - Alice's mother has:   - **1 sister (Aunt1)** who **does not have children**.   - **2 brothers**. - Aunt1 has **6 nephews and nieces**.  Aunt1's nephews and nieces are the children of her siblings (since she has no children herself). This includes the children of Alice's mother and her 2 brothers. We know Alice's mother has **5 children** (from the paternal side information), so the 6 nephews and nieces are: - **5 children from Alice's mother**. - **1 child from the 2 brothers** (since 5 + 1 = 6).  **Calculating the Number of Cousins:** - **Maternal Cousins**: Alice's sister has **1 cousin** from her mother's side (the single child from her uncles). - **Paternal Cousins**: Alice's sister has **2 cousins** from her father's side (the 2 daughters of Uncle1).    **Total Cousins**: 1 (maternal) + 2 (paternal) = **3 cousins**.  ### Answer: 3",
