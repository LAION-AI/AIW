        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's break down the information provided:  - Alice has 3 male friends and 6 female friends. - All of these friends are friends with each other and have no other friends outside this group. - Including Alice, there are a total of 1 (Alice) + 3 (male friends) + 6 (female friends) = **10 people** in the group.  Since everyone is friends with each other, each person (including the male friends) is friends with the other 9 people in the group.  For any one of Alice's male friends, their friends consist of:  - **6 female friends** (Alice's female friends). - **Alice herself** (also a female). - **2 other male friends** (the other male friends of Alice).  Therefore, the number of female friends that a male friend of Alice has is:  - **6 (female friends) + 1 (Alice) = 7 female friends**.  ### Answer: 7",

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:  1. **Total Friends of Alice**: Alice has 3 male friends and 6 female friends, making a total of 9 friends.  2. **Relationships Between Friends**: All of Alice's friends are friends with each other. This means:    - Each male friend is friends with:      - The other 2 male friends (since there are 3 male friends in total).      - The 6 female friends.      - Alice herself.  3. **Counting Female Friends of a Male Friend**:    - Each male friend counts as friends the 6 female friends of Alice.    - Since Alice is also a friend and she is female, she should be included in the count.    - Therefore, each male friend has:      - 6 (female friends of Alice) + 1 (Alice) = **7 female friends**.  ### Answer: 7",
