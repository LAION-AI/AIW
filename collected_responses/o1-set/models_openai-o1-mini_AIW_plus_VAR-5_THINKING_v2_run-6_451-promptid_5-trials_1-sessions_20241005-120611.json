        "model_response":"To determine how many cousins Alice's sister has, let's break down the information step by step:  1. **Alice's Immediate Family:**    - Alice has 3 sisters, making a total of 4 children in the immediate family.  2. **Mother's Side:**    - Alice's mother has 1 sister (a maternal aunt) who does not have children.    - This maternal aunt has 2 brothers. Since she has no children of her own, her nephews and nieces come from her two brothers.    - The maternal aunt has 6 nephews and nieces in total. These are Alice and her 3 sisters plus potentially children from the maternal aunt's brothers.    - Therefore, the maternal aunt's two brothers have a combined total of 6 children (Alice and her 3 sisters are part of this count, but since they're already accounted for in the immediate family, we consider only additional cousins).  3. **Father's Side:**    - Alice's father has a brother (a paternal uncle).    - This paternal uncle has 5 nephews and nieces in total.    - The uncle also has 1 son of his own.    - The nephews and nieces include Alice and her 3 sisters, totaling 4. Therefore, the uncle's 1 son is an additional cousin.  4. **Total Cousins:**    - From the mother's side: 6 cousins.    - From the father's side: 1 cousin (the uncle's son).  **Total cousins Alice's sister has = 6 (mother's side) + 1 (father's side) = 7.**  ### Answer: 7",
