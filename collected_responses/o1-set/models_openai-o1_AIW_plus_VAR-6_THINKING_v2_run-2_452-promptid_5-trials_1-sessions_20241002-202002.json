        "model_response":"Let's map out the family relationships step by step:  1. **Alice's Immediate Family**:    - Alice has **2 sisters**. Including herself, that makes **3 siblings**.    - However, we later learn that Alice's father has a brother who has **4 nephews and nieces** from Alice's father's side. Since Alice's father has only one sibling (the brother), those nephews and nieces must be Alice and her siblings.    - This means Alice's parents have **4 children** (since the uncle has 4 nephews and nieces), so Alice has **2 sisters and 1 brother**, totaling **4 siblings**.  2. **Mother's Side**:    - Alice's mother has **1 sister** (who has no children) and **2 brothers**.    - The aunt (mother's sister) has **6 nephews and nieces**. These are the children of her siblings: Alice's mother and the two brothers.    - Alice's mother has **4 children** (Alice and her siblings), so her brothers must have **2 children in total** (since 6 total nephews and nieces minus 4 children from Alice's mother leaves 2 children from the brothers).  3. **Father's Side**:    - Alice's father has **1 brother**.    - This brother (Alice's uncle) has **2 daughters**.    - He also has **4 nephews and nieces**, which correspond to Alice and her siblings.  4. **Total Cousins for Alice's Sister**:    - **Maternal cousins**: The children of Alice's mother's brothers (2 uncles) = **2 cousins**.    - **Paternal cousins**: The children of Alice's father's brother = **2 cousins**.    - **Total cousins**: 2 (maternal) + 2 (paternal) = **4 cousins**.  ### Answer: 4",

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we'll dissect the family relationships step by step:  **1. Alice's Immediate Family:** - Alice has 2 sisters, so there are 3 siblings in Alice's immediate family. - Given that Alice's father's brother has 4 nephews and nieces and Alice's mother has 3 children, Alice must have a brother as well to make up the total of 4 nephews and nieces. So, Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother.  **2. Alice's Mother's Siblings and Their Children:** - Alice's mother has 1 sister (who is childless) and 2 brothers. - The childless sister has 6 nephews and nieces, who are the children of her siblings. - Alice's mother has 4 children (Alice, her 2 sisters, and 1 brother). - Therefore, the two brothers must have a total of 2 children (since 6 nephews and nieces - 4 from Alice's mother = 2 from the brothers).  **3. Alice's Father's Siblings and Their Children:** - Alice's father has a brother who has 2 daughters. - This brother has 4 nephews and nieces, who are the children of his siblings. - Since Alice's father has 4 children, these are the 4 nephews and nieces. - There are no other siblings mentioned, so the father's side has 2 cousins for Alice's sister.  **4. Total Cousins for Alice's Sister:** - From her mother's side: 2 cousins (children of the mother's brothers). - From her father's side: 2 cousins (daughters of her father's brother). - Total cousins: 2 (mother's side) + 2 (father's side) = **4 cousins**.  However, since Alice's sister cannot be her own cousin, we only count the cousins outside her immediate siblings.  **Final Answer:**  ### Answer: 5",
