        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we'll carefully consider the family relationships and the total number of siblings:  1. **Alice has 2 brothers**: This means there are 2 boys in the family. 2. **Alice has 3 sisters**: Since Alice is herself a sister, there are 4 girls in total (Alice + 3 sisters). 3. **Bob is a brother of Alice**: Bob is one of the 2 brothers.  Now, we're asked how many sisters Bob has. Since Bob is Alice's brother, his siblings are:  - **1 brother** (the other brother, not himself) - **4 sisters** (Alice and her 3 sisters)  Therefore, Bob has **4 sisters**.  ### Answer: 4",
