        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we'll determine the number of cousins Alice's sister has by calculating the total number of first cousins from both her mother's and father's sides.  **On Alice's Mother's Side:**  - **Alice's mother** has:   - **1 sister** who **does not have children**.   - **2 brothers**.  - The **mother has 7 nephews and nieces** in total. Since her sister has no children, these 7 nephews and nieces must be the children of her 2 brothers.  - Therefore, **Alice has 7 maternal cousins**.  **On Alice's Father's Side:**  - **Alice's father** has:   - **1 brother** who **has 1 son**.    - The father's brother **has 5 nephews and nieces**. These are his siblings' children.  - **Alice's father** must have at least **one other sibling** besides the brother because Alice's uncle has **5 nephews and nieces**, and Alice's father has **4 daughters** (Alice and her 3 sisters). That accounts for 4 nephews\/nieces; thus, there's at least one more nephew\/niece, implying another sibling with at least **1 child**.  - Therefore, **Alice has 2 paternal cousins** (the uncle's son and the child of the other sibling).  **Total Cousins:**  - **Maternal cousins:** 7 - **Paternal cousins:** 2 - **Total cousins:** 7 + 2 = **9**  ### Answer: 9",

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step by analyzing Alice's family tree.  1. **Alice's Immediate Family**: Alice has 3 sisters, so there are 4 daughters in total in Alice's immediate family.  2. **Maternal Side**:    - Alice's mother has:      - 1 sister who **does not have children**.      - 2 brothers.    - The childless sister has **7 nephews and nieces**. Since she doesn't have children, these are the children of her siblings.      - **Alice's mother** has 4 children (Alice and her sisters).      - The **2 brothers** must have the remaining children. Since the total nephews and nieces are 7, the brothers have **3 children** collectively.    - Therefore, Alice has **3 cousins** on her mother's side (the children of her two maternal uncles).  3. **Paternal Side**:    - Alice's father has a brother who has:      - **1 son**.      - **5 nephews and nieces**. These are the children of his siblings.    - Since we know Alice's father has 4 daughters (Alice and her sisters), there must be another sibling to account for the total of 5 nephews and nieces.      - This implies that Alice's father has a **sister** who has **1 child**.    - Therefore, the uncle's nephews and nieces are:      - Alice and her 3 sisters (**4 nieces**).      - The child of the aunt (**1 nephew\/niece**).    - Alice has **2 cousins** on her father's side (the child of her paternal aunt and the son of her paternal uncle).  4. **Total Cousins**:    - **Maternal cousins**: 3    - **Paternal cousins**: 2    - **Total**: 3 + 2 = **5 cousins**  So, Alice's sister has **5 cousins**.  ### Answer: 5",
