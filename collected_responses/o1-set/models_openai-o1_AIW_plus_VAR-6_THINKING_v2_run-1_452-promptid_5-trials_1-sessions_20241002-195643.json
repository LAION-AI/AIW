        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's break down the family tree and relationships carefully:  **Alice's Immediate Family:** - Alice has **2 sisters**. - From the information about Alice's father's brother (paternal uncle) having **4 nephews and nieces**, it implies that Alice's parents have **4 children** (since the only source of nephews and nieces for the uncle is Alice's father's children). Therefore, Alice must also have **1 brother**. - So, Alice's immediate family consists of **4 children**: Alice, 2 sisters, and 1 brother.  **Maternal Side:** - Alice's mother has:   - **1 sister** who has **no children**.   - **2 brothers** (Alice's maternal uncles). - The childless aunt has **6 nephews and nieces**, who are the children of her siblings (Alice's mother and the 2 brothers). - Since Alice's mother has **4 children** and the total nephews and nieces are **6**, the **2 maternal uncles must have 2 children in total**.  **Paternal Side:** - Alice's father has **1 brother** (paternal uncle) who has:   - **2 daughters** (Alice's cousins).   - **4 nephews and nieces** (Alice and her 3 siblings).  **Calculating Alice's Sister's Cousins:** - **Maternal Cousins:** 2 children from the maternal uncles. - **Paternal Cousins:** 2 daughters of the paternal uncle. - **Total Cousins:** \\( 2 + 2 = 4 \\).  ### Answer: 4",

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we need to carefully reconstruct Alice's family tree based on the information given.  **Maternal Side:** - Alice's mother has **1 sister** (Aunt S) who **does not have children** and who has **6 nephews and nieces**. She also has **2 brothers** (Uncles B1 and B2). - The nephews and nieces of Aunt S are the children of her siblings, since she has no children herself. - Alice's mother has at least **3 children** (Alice and her **2 sisters**). We are told Alice has **2 sisters**. - Since Aunt S has **6 nephews and nieces**, and Alice's mother has **3 children**, Uncles B1 and B2 must have a total of **3 children** between them (because 3 from Alice's mother + 3 from the uncles = 6 nephews and nieces).  **Paternal Side:** - Alice's father has a **brother** (Uncle U) who has **2 daughters** and **4 nephews and nieces**. - The nephews and nieces of Uncle U are the children of his siblings. - Assuming Alice's father has no other siblings, the **4 nephews and nieces** must be the children of Alice's father. - Therefore, Alice's father has **4 children** (Alice, her **2 sisters**, and an **implied brother**).  **Calculating the Number of Cousins:** - **Maternal cousins** are the children of Uncles B1 and B2, totaling **3 cousins** (we calculated earlier that the uncles have 3 children in total). - **Paternal cousins** are the **2 daughters** of Uncle U. - Therefore, the total number of cousins is **3 maternal cousins + 2 paternal cousins = 5 cousins**.  But this conflicts with the earlier calculation of nephews and nieces. Realigning our calculations:  - Alice's mother's sister has **6 nephews and nieces**, with **Alice's mother contributing 4 children** (Alice, her two sisters, and a brother), so the uncles must have **2 children** (because 4 from Alice's mother + 2 from the uncles = 6). - Therefore, there are **2 maternal cousins**. - On the paternal side, Uncle U has **4 nephews and nieces**, which are Alice and her siblings (totaling 4), matching our earlier conclusion that Alice has **3 sisters and 1 brother**.  So, the total number of cousins is: - **2 maternal cousins** (children of B1 and B2) - **2 paternal cousins** (daughters of Uncle U) - **Total cousins = 2 + 2 = 4**  ### Answer: 4",
