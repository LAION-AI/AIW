First, let's identify Alice's immediate family:    - Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother    - So, Alice's parents have 4 children in total  2.

Alice's father's side:    - Alice's father has 2 sisters    - Alice's father has 1 brother    - This brother has 4 nephews and nieces and 1 son  4. Let's count the cousins:    - From mother's side:      * 2 uncles, but we don't know if they have children      * We know the aunt has no children    - From father's side:      * 2 aunts, but we don't know if they have children      * 1 uncle who has 1 son  5. The only confirmed cousin is the son of Alice's father's brother  6. We need to be careful here:    - The 6 nephews and nieces of Alice's mother's sister include Alice and her siblings (4 in total)    - The 4 nephews and nieces of Alice's father's brother also include Alice and her siblings  7. These numbers don't give us any additional information about cousins  8. Therefore, we can only confirm one cousin for Alice's sister  Double-checking: - We've considered both sides of the family - We've been careful not to count Alice and her siblings as cousins - We've only counted confirmed information  ### Answer: 1",

On Alice's father's side:    - Her father has 2 sisters    - Her father has 1 brother who has 1 son    - This uncle has 4 nephews and nieces in total  4. To find Alice's sister's cousins, we need to count the children of Alice's aunts and uncles, excluding Alice and her siblings.  5. From the mother's side:    - We don't know how many children the mother's brothers have    - The mother's sister has no children  6. From the father's side:    - We don't know how many children the father's sisters have    - The father's brother has 1 son  7. The key information is that Alice's father's brother has 4 nephews and nieces in total. This includes Alice and her 3 siblings.  8. Since Alice and her siblings account for all 4 of these nephews and nieces, it means that Alice's father's sisters don't have any children.  9. Therefore, the only cousin we can confirm is the 1 son of Alice's father's brother.  Double-checking this reasoning, we can see that all the information provided is consistent with this conclusion. Alice's sister would have the same number of cousins as Alice.  ### Answer: 1",

Alice's mother has 2 brothers, so Alice has 2 uncles on her mother's side. 3. Alice's mother has 1 sister who does not have children but has 6 nephews and nieces in total. These 6 nephews and nieces are the children of Alice's mother's brothers, which means they are Alice's cousins on her mother's side. 4. Alice's father has 2 sisters, so Alice has 2 aunts on her father's side. 5. Alice's father has a brother who has 4 nephews and nieces in total and 1 son. The 4 nephews and nieces are Alice's cousins on her father's side, and the 1 son is also Alice's cousin.  Now, let's count the total number of cousins Alice has: - 6 cousins from her mother's side - 4 cousins from her father's side - 1 additional cousin (the son of her father's brother)  In total, Alice has 6 + 4 + 1 = 11 cousins.  Since Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother, and the question asks about Alice's sister's cousins, we can conclude that Alice's sister has the same number of cousins as Alice.  Double-checking the solution: - The total number of cousins is correctly calculated based on the given information. - Alice and her siblings share the same cousins, so Alice's sister has the same number of cousins as Alice.  ### Answer: Alice's sister has 11 cousins.",

This means that Alice's sister (let's call her Sister A) has 1 sister (Alice) and 1 brother.  2. Alice's mother has 2 brothers. These brothers are uncles to Sister A, and their children are Sister A's cousins.  3. Alice's mother also has 1 sister who does not have children.
