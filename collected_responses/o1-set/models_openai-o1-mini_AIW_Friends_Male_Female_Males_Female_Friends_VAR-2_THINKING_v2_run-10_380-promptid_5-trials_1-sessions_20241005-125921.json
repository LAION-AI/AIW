        "model_response":"To determine how many female friends a male friend of Alice has, let's break down the information step by step:  1. **Alice's Friends:**    - Alice has **2 female friends**.    - Alice also has **4 male friends**.     2. **Friendship Structure:**    - All of Alice's friends (both male and female) are friends with each other.    - They have **no other friends** aside from this group.  3. **Analyzing a Male Friend's Female Friends:**    - Considering a male friend of Alice, this individual is part of the group of 6 friends.    - Since all 6 friends are mutually friends with each other:      - The male friend is friends with the 2 female friends.      - He is also friends with the other 3 male friends (excluding himself).    - Alice is not included in the mutual friendship group since the statement specifies that \"they\" (the friends) have no other friends aside.  4. **Conclusion:**    - A male friend of Alice has **2 female friends** within the group.  ### Answer: 2",
