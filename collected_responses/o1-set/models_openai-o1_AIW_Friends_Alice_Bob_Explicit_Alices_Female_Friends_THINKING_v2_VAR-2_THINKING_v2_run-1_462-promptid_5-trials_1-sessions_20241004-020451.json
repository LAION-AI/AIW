        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many female friends Alice has, given the provided information and the constraints.  Let's start by defining the total number of people and their genders:  - Let **\\( m \\)** be the total number of males in the group. - Let **\\( f \\)** be the total number of females in the group. - The total number of people in the group is **\\( N = m + f \\)**.  Given that **Alice has 6 male friends**, and **Bob has 4 female friends**, and knowing that **they all form a clique (everyone is friends with everyone else in the group)**, we can set up the following equations:  1. **Alice's male friends:**    Since Alice is female and friends with all males in the group (excluding herself), the number of male friends Alice has is equal to the total number of males:    \\[    m = 6    \\]  2. **Bob's female friends:**    Similarly, Bob is male and friends with all females in the group (excluding himself), so the number of female friends Bob has is equal to the total number of females:    \\[    f = 4    \\]  Now, we can calculate the total number of people in the group: \\[ N = m + f = 6 + 4 = 10 \\]  Since everyone in the group is friends with everyone else, **Alice's total number of friends** is: \\[ \\text{Alice's friends} = N - 1 = 10 - 1 = 9 \\]  We already know Alice has **6 male friends**, so the number of female friends Alice has is: \\[ \\text{Alice's female friends} = \\text{Total friends} - \\text{Male friends} = 9 - 6 = 3 \\]  Therefore, Alice has **3 female friends**.  ### Answer: 3",
