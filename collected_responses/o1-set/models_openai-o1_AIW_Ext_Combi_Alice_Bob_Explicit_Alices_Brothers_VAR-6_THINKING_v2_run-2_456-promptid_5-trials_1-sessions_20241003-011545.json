Therefore, there are a total of **4 sisters** in the family (Alice plus her 3 sisters).  3. **Bob has 5 brothers**, which **does not include himself**. Therefore, there are a total of **6 brothers** in the family (Bob plus his 5 brothers).  4. The total number of children in the family is the sum of all brothers and sisters:    - **Total siblings = Total sisters + Total brothers = 4 sisters + 6 brothers = 10 children**.  5. **Alice's brothers** are the **6 brothers** in the family (since she is a sister and all the male siblings are her brothers).  ### Answer: 6",

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's carefully dissect the information provided:  1. **Alice and Bob are sister and brother**: This means they are siblings in the same family.     2. **Alice has 3 sisters**: This implies **Alice has 3 sisters besides herself**. So, including Alice, there are **4 sisters** in total.  3. **Bob has 5 brothers**: Similarly, Bob has **5 brothers besides himself**. Including Bob, there are **6 brothers** in total.  Since Alice and Bob are siblings in the same family, the family has:  - **4 sisters (including Alice)** - **6 brothers (including Bob)**    Therefore, the total number of children in the family is **4 sisters + 6 brothers = 10 children**.  **Question**: How many brothers does Alice have?  Given that there are **6 brothers** in total, and they are all siblings to Alice, **Alice has 6 brothers**.  ### Answer: 6",

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's carefully consider the information given step by step:  1. **Alice and Bob are sister and brother.** This means they are siblings in the same family.  2. **Alice has 3 sisters.** When someone says they have a certain number of sisters, they are excluding themselves from the count. So, there are 3 other girls besides Alice in the family. Including Alice, there are **4 girls** in total.  3. **Bob has 5 brothers.** Similarly, Bob is not counting himself when he says he has 5 brothers. So, there are 5 other boys besides Bob. Including Bob, there are **6 boys** in total.  4. **Total number of children in the family:** Adding up the total number of boys and girls:    - Boys: 6    - Girls: 4    - Total children: \\(6 + 4 = 10\\)  5. **Finding out how many brothers Alice has:**    - Alice's total siblings are the total children minus herself: \\(10 - 1 = 9\\)    - She has 3 sisters, so the remaining siblings are her brothers.    - Number of brothers: \\(9 - 3 = 6\\)  **Answer: 6 brothers.**",
