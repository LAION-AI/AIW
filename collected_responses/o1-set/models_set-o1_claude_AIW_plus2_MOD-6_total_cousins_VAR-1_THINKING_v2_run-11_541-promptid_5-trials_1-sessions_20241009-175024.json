        "model_response":"Let's think through this step by step:  1. Alice has 1 sister and 1 brother. This means Alice's parents have 3 children in total.  2. Alice's mother has:    - 2 brothers    - 1 sister (who has no children)  3. Alice's mother's sister has 2 nephews and 4 nieces. This matches the 3 children of Alice's parents (Alice, her sister, and her brother) plus 3 other children. These 3 other children must be cousins from Alice's mother's brothers.  4. Alice's father has:    - 2 sisters    - 1 brother  5. Alice's father's brother has:    - 1 nephew (which must be Alice's brother)    - 4 nieces (which must be Alice and her sister, plus 2 more)    - 2 sons of his own  6. From points 3 and 5, we can conclude:    - Alice's mother's brothers have 3 children in total    - Alice's father's brother has 2 sons    - Alice's father's sisters have 2 daughters in total  7. To find Alice's sister's cousins, we need to add up all the children of Alice's aunts and uncles:    - 3 from mother's side    - 2 from father's brother    - 2 from father's sisters    - Total: 3 + 2 + 2 = 7  Therefore, Alice's sister has 7 cousins.  ### Answer: 7",

Alice's mother has:    - 2 brothers    - 1 sister (who has no children)  3. Alice's father has:    - 2 sisters    - 1 brother  4. Let's focus on Alice's uncle (father's brother):    - He has 1 nephew and 4 nieces in total    - He also has 2 sons  5. The nephew and nieces of Alice's uncle must be Alice, her siblings, and her cousins from her father's sisters. We know 3 of these (Alice and her siblings), so the remaining 2 must be cousins from her father's sisters.  6. So, Alice's cousins from her father's side are:    - 2 from her father's sisters    - 2 from her father's brother  7. Now, let's look at Alice's mother's side:    - Her mother's sister has no children    - Her mother's brothers might have children, but we don't have information about that  8. The total number of cousins Alice's sister has is:    - 2 (from father's sisters) + 2 (from father's brother) = 4  9. Double-checking: This matches with the information that Alice's uncle (on her father's side) has 4 nieces in total (Alice, Alice's sister, and 2 female cousins from father's sisters).  Therefore, Alice's sister has 4 cousins.  ### Answer: 4",

        "model_response":"Let's think through this step by step:  1. We need to find Alice's cousins, which would be the same as Alice's sister's cousins.  2. Cousins come from aunts and uncles, so we need to count the children of Alice's aunts and uncles.  3. From Alice's mother's side:    - Her mother has 2 brothers    - Her mother has 1 sister, but this sister has no children  4. From Alice's father's side:    - Her father has 2 sisters    - Her father has 1 brother  5. Now, let's count the children:    - We don't have information about the children of Alice's mother's brothers or father's sisters    - We know Alice's father's brother has 2 sons  6. We're also given information about nephews and nieces:    - Alice's mother's sister has 2 nephews and 4 nieces    - Alice's father's brother has 1 nephew and 4 nieces  7. The nephew and niece information is tricky because it could include Alice and her siblings. We need to be careful not to double count.  8. We know for certain that Alice's father's brother has 2 sons, and these would be Alice's cousins.  9. We don't have enough information to determine if there are any other cousins from the other aunts and uncles.  10. Therefore, the only cousins we can confirm with certainty are the 2 sons of Alice's father's brother.  After careful consideration, we can only be certain about these 2 cousins.  ### Answer: 2",

Now, let's look at Alice's mother's side:    - Alice's mother has 2 brothers    - Alice's mother has 1 sister who doesn't have children  3. On Alice's father's side:    - Alice's father has 2 sisters    - Alice's father has 1 brother  4. Let's focus on Alice's father's brother:    - He has 1 nephew and 4 nieces in total    - He has 2 sons  5. To find Alice's sister's cousins, we need to count the children of Alice's aunts and uncles:    - Mother's side: 2 uncles, but we don't know how many children they have    - Father's side: 2 aunts (unknown number of children) and 1 uncle with 2 sons  6. The key information is that Alice's father's brother has 1 nephew and 4 nieces in total:    - The 1 nephew must be Alice's brother    - The 4 nieces must be Alice, her sister, and 2 cousins from the father's sisters  7. So, we can conclude:    - Alice's father's sisters have 2 daughters in total    - Alice's father's brother has 2 sons  8. Therefore, Alice's sister's cousins are:    - 2 cousins (daughters of father's sisters)    - 2 cousins (sons of father's brother)  9. We don't have information about cousins from the mother's side, so we can't include them.  Double-checking this reasoning, it appears to be consistent with the given information.  ### Answer: 4",
