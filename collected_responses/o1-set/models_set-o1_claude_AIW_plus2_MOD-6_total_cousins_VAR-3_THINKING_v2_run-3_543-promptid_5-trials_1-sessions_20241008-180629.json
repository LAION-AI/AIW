On Alice's father's side:    - Father has 2 sisters    - Father has 1 brother who has 1 son    - This uncle has 1 nephew and 4 nieces  4. To find Alice's sister's cousins, we need to count the children of Alice's aunts and uncles:    - Mother's 2 brothers: We don't know if they have children or not    - Mother's sister: No children    - Father's 2 sisters: We don't know if they have children    - Father's brother: Has 1 son  5.

        "model_response":"Let's think through this step-by-step:  1. We need to find Alice's cousins, which would be the same as Alice's sister's cousins.  2. Cousins come from the children of Alice's aunts and uncles.  3. From Alice's mother's side:    - Her mother has 2 brothers    - Her mother has 1 sister, but this sister doesn't have children  4. From Alice's father's side:    - Her father has 2 sisters    - Her father has 1 brother, who has 1 son  5. Let's count the cousins:    - From mother's side: We don't know if the 2 brothers have children, so we can't count any cousins from this side yet.    - From father's side: We know his brother has 1 son, so that's 1 cousin.     6. Now, let's look at the additional information given:    - Alice's mother's sister (who doesn't have children) has 3 nephews and 4 nieces in total.    - Alice's father's brother has 1 nephew and 4 nieces in total.  7. The information about Alice's father's brother is crucial:    - He has 1 nephew (which must be Alice's brother)    - He has 4 nieces (which must be Alice and her 2 sisters, plus 1 more)  8. This tells us that one of Alice's father's sisters must have 1 child (a girl), because we've accounted for all of Alice's siblings and the 1 cousin we already knew about.  9. So, the total count of cousins is:    - 1 (the son of Alice's father's brother)    - 1 (the daughter of one of Alice's father's sisters)  10. Double-checking: We don't have enough information about Alice's mother's brothers to know if they have any children, so we can't include any potential cousins from that side.  Therefore, the final count of cousins is 2.  ### Answer: 2",
