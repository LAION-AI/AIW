We know that Alice, her sister, and her 3 brothers make up 5 of these nephews and nieces.  6.

Given: - Alice has 1 sister and 3 brothers. - Alice's mother has 2 brothers. - Alice's mother has 1 sister who does not have children and has 4 nephews and 2 nieces in total. - Alice's father has 2 sisters. - Alice's father has a brother who has 3 nephews and 2 nieces in total, and who also has 1 daughter.  Step 1: Determine the number of cousins from Alice's mother's side. - Alice's mother has 2 brothers, so their children would be Alice's cousins. - The total number of nephews and nieces of Alice's mother's sister is 6 (4 nephews + 2 nieces). - Since Alice has 1 sister and 3 brothers, the number of cousins from Alice's mother's brothers is 6 - 4 = 2.  Step 2: Determine the number of cousins from Alice's father's side. - Alice's father has 2 sisters, so their children would be Alice's cousins. - Alice's father's brother has 1 daughter, who is also Alice's cousin.  Step 3: Calculate the total number of cousins for Alice's sister. - Alice's sister has the same number of cousins as Alice. - Total number of cousins = Cousins from mother's side + Cousins from father's side - Total number of cousins = 2 + (2 sisters' children + 1 daughter of father's brother) - The number of children of Alice's father's sisters is not given, so we cannot determine the exact number of cousins.
