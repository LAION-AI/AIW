        "model_response":"Let's break down the problem step by step:  1. **Understanding the Information:**    - Alice has 2 brothers.    - Alice has 3 sisters.  2. **Determining Total Siblings:**    - **Brothers:** Alice has 2 brothers.    - **Sisters:** Alice has 3 sisters. This typically means 3 sisters **in addition to** Alice.    - **Total Sisters Including Alice:** 3 sisters + Alice = 4 sisters.  3. **Analyzing from the Brother's Perspective:**    - Each brother shares the same siblings.    - Therefore, each brother has:      - 2 brothers (excluding themselves).      - 4 sisters (including Alice and her 3 sisters).  4. **Conclusion:**    - Alice's brother has **4 sisters**.  ### Answer: 4",
