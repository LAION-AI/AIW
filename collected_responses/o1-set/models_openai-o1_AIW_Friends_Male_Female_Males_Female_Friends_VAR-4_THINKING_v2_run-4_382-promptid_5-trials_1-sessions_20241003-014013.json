        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we need to carefully interpret the information given:  1. **Alice has 4 male friends and 1 female friend.** 2. **They all are friends with each other and have no other friends aside.**  First, let's list out the people involved:  - **Alice** (Female) - **Female Friend (F1)** - **Male Friend 1 (M1)** - **Male Friend 2 (M2)** - **Male Friend 3 (M3)** - **Male Friend 4 (M4)**  Now, let's interpret \"They all are friends with each other and have no other friends aside.\" This means:  - All of Alice's friends (the 4 males and 1 female) are mutual friends with each other. - They have no friends outside of this group (excluding Alice, who may or may not have other friends).  Given that, each male friend of Alice is friends with:  - **Alice** - **The other 3 male friends** - **The female friend (F1)**  So, focusing on any one of the male friends (say M1), his friends are:  - **Alice** (Female) - **F1** (Female) - **M2** (Male) - **M3** (Male) - **M4** (Male)  Therefore, **the male friend has 2 female friends**: Alice and F1.  ### Answer: 2",
