We're also told that Alice's mother's sister has 2 nephews and 4 nieces:    - The 2 nephews are likely Alice's brother and one of her cousins from her father's side    - The 4 nieces likely include Alice, her sister, and 2 cousins from her father's side  6. From this information, we can deduce:    - Alice has 2 male cousins (her father's brother's 2 sons)    - Alice likely has 2 female cousins (to make up the 4 nieces mentioned for both her father's brother and her mother's sister)  7. Therefore, Alice's sister would have the same number of cousins:    2 male cousins + 2 female cousins = 4 cousins in total  Let's double-check: - This matches with the information given about Alice's father's brother having 1 nephew (Alice's brother) and 4 nieces (Alice, her sister, and 2 female cousins) - It also matches with Alice's mother's sister having 2 nephews (Alice's brother and 1 male cousin) and 4 nieces (Alice, her sister, and 2 female cousins)  ### Answer: 4",

        "model_response":"Let's think through this step-by-step:  1. First, we need to identify Alice's aunts and uncles:    - From her mother's side: 2 uncles and 1 aunt    - From her father's side: 1 uncle and 2 aunts    Total: 3 uncles and 3 aunts  2. Now, let's look at the children of these aunts and uncles:    - Mother's sister: No children    - Father's brother: 2 sons    - We don't have information about the children of the other aunts and uncles  3. We know that Alice's father's brother has 1 nephew and 4 nieces in total:    - The nephew is likely one of Alice's brothers    - The 4 nieces likely include Alice and her sister  4. This means that Alice's father's brother's 2 sons are Alice's cousins  5. We also know that Alice's mother's sister has 2 nephews and 4 nieces:    - These are likely the same as mentioned above (Alice, her siblings, and her father's brother's children)    - This confirms that there are no other cousins from Alice's mother's side  6. We don't have any information about children from Alice's other aunts and uncles, so we can't assume any additional cousins  7. Therefore, the only confirmed cousins are the 2 sons of Alice's father's brother  8. Alice's sister would have the same cousins as Alice  Double-checking: - We've accounted for all given information - We haven't made any assumptions about unknown information - The number of cousins is consistent with the information about nephews and nieces  ### Answer: 2",

        "model_response":"Let's think through this step by step:  1. First, let's identify Alice's immediate family:    - Alice has 1 sister and 1 brother    - So Alice's parents have 3 children in total  2. Now, let's look at Alice's mother's side:    - Alice's mother has 2 brothers    - Alice's mother has 1 sister who doesn't have children    - This sister has 2 nephews and 4 nieces in total    - These 6 children must be from Alice's mother and her 2 brothers  3. Let's examine Alice's father's side:    - Alice's father has 2 sisters    - Alice's father has 1 brother    - This brother has 1 nephew and 4 nieces in total    - This brother also has 2 sons  4. Now, let's count the cousins:    - From mother's side:      * 2 uncles, but we don't know exactly how many children they have      * We know there are 6 children in total (2 nephews + 4 nieces)      * But 3 of these are Alice and her siblings      * So there are 3 cousins from mother's side (6 - 3)     - From father's side:      * 2 aunts, but we don't know if they have children      * 1 uncle with 2 sons      * So there are 2 cousins from father's side  5. Total cousins:    3 (from mother's side) + 2 (from father's side) = 5 cousins  6. Double-checking:    - This matches with the information about Alice's father's brother having 1 nephew (Alice's brother) and 4 nieces (Alice, Alice's sister, and 2 female cousins from mother's side)  Therefore, Alice's sister has 5 cousins.  ### Answer: 5",
