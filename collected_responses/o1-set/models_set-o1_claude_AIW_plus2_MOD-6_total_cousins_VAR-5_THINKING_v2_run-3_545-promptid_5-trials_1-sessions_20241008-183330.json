        "model_response":"To find out how many cousins Alice's sister has, let's break down the information given and solve the problem step by step.  Given: - Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother in total. - Alice's mother has 2 brothers. - Alice's mother has 1 sister who does not have children and who has 2 nephews and 4 nieces in total. - Alice's father has 2 sisters. - Alice's father has a brother who has 1 nephew and 4 nieces in total, and who also has 1 son.  Step 1: Determine the number of cousins from Alice's mother's side. - Alice's mother has 2 brothers, but we don't know how many children they have. - Alice's mother's sister has no children, so she does not contribute to the number of cousins.  Step 2: Determine the number of cousins from Alice's father's side. - Alice's father has 2 sisters, but we don't know how many children they have. - Alice's father has a brother who has 1 son.  Step 3: Calculate the total number of known cousins. - From Alice's father's brother: 1 cousin (his son)  Step 4: Determine the number of unknown cousins. - Alice's mother's 2 brothers: unknown number of cousins - Alice's father's 2 sisters: unknown number of cousins  Final answer: Based on the given information, we can only confirm that Alice's sister has at least 1 cousin (from Alice's father's brother). The total number of cousins cannot be determined due to the unknown number of children Alice's mother's brothers and Alice's father's sisters have.  ### Answer: The total number of cousins Alice's sister has cannot be determined based on the given information. We only know that she has at least 1 cousin.",

        "model_response":"Let's solve this problem step by step:  1. Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother in total, which means she has 3 siblings.  2. Alice's mother has 2 brothers. Each of these brothers could potentially have children who would be Alice's cousins.  3. Alice's mother also has 1 sister who does not have children. This sister has 2 nephews and 4 nieces in total. These nephews and nieces are Alice's cousins.    * Number of cousins from Alice's mother's side = 2 nephews + 4 nieces = 6 cousins  4. Alice's father has 2 sisters. Each of these sisters could potentially have children who would be Alice's cousins.  5. Alice's father also has a brother who has 1 nephew and 4 nieces in total. However, this brother also has 1 son. The nephew and nieces mentioned are the children of Alice's father's siblings (i.e., Alice's aunts or uncles), so they are Alice's cousins. The son of Alice's father's brother is also Alice's cousin.    * Number of cousins from Alice's father's side = 1 nephew + 4 nieces + 1 son = 6 cousins  6. The total number of cousins Alice has is the sum of cousins from her mother's side and her father's side.    * Total number of Alice's cousins = 6 (from mother's side) + 6 (from father's side) = 12 cousins  7. Since Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother, each of her siblings will have the same number of cousins as Alice.  Double-checking the solution: - Alice's mother's side contributes 6 cousins (2 nephews + 4 nieces from the sister who doesn't have children). - Alice's father's side contributes 6 cousins (1 nephew + 4 nieces + 1 son from the brother). - The total number of cousins is 6 + 6 = 12, which matches the calculated result.  ### Answer: Alice's sister has 12 cousins.",
