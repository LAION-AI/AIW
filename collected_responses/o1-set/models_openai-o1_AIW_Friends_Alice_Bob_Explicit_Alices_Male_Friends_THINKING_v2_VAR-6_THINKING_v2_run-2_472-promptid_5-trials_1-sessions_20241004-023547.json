        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of male friends Alice has, given the information provided.  Let's denote: - **\\( F \\)** as the total number of females in the group. - **\\( M \\)** as the total number of males in the group.  From the problem, we know that: 1. Alice has 8 female friends. 2. Bob has 5 male friends. 3. All mentioned persons (including Alice and Bob) are friends with each other and have no other friends outside this group.  Since Alice cannot be friends with herself, the total number of females in the group is: \\[ F = \\text{Number of Alice's female friends} + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9 \\] (The additional 1 accounts for Alice herself.)  Similarly, since Bob cannot be friends with himself, the total number of males in the group is: \\[ M = \\text{Number of Bob's male friends} + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6 \\] (The additional 1 accounts for Bob himself.)  Therefore, the total number of people in the group is: \\[ \\text{Total people} = F + M = 9 + 6 = 15 \\]  Since everyone in the group is friends with each other, Alice's total number of friends is: \\[ \\text{Alice's total friends} = \\text{Total people} - 1 = 15 - 1 = 14 \\] (The \"-1\" accounts for Alice herself.)  We already know that 8 of Alice's friends are female. Therefore, the number of male friends Alice has is: \\[ \\text{Alice's male friends} = \\text{Alice's total friends} - \\text{Alice's female friends} = 14 - 8 = 6 \\]  **Answer: 6**",
