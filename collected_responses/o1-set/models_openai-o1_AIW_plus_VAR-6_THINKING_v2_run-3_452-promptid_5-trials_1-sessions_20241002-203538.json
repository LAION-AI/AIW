        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of cousins Alice's sister has by carefully analyzing the family relations provided.  1. **Alice's Immediate Family**: Alice has two sisters. We learn later that Alice's father's brother has four nephews and nieces, implying that Alice's parents have four children (since the uncle's nephews and nieces are Alice and her siblings). Therefore, Alice's family consists of Alice, her two sisters, and one brother.  2. **Maternal Side**:    - **Alice's Mother\u2019s Siblings**: Alice's mother has one sister (who is childless) and two brothers.    - **Childless Aunt's Nephews and Nieces**: This aunt has six nephews and nieces, who are the children of her siblings.      - From Alice's mother: Four children (Alice and her siblings).      - That leaves **two children** from the two brothers (since 6 - 4 = 2).  3. **Paternal Side**:    - **Alice's Father's Siblings**: Alice's father has one brother.    - **Paternal Uncle's Children**: This uncle has two daughters.    - **Uncle's Nephews and Nieces**: He has four nephews and nieces, who are Alice and her siblings.  4. **Total Cousins**: Alice's sister's cousins are the children of her parents' siblings (excluding their own children). So:    - **From Maternal Side**: Two cousins (children of the two maternal uncles).    - **From Paternal Side**: Two cousins (daughters of the paternal uncle).    - **Total**: 2 (maternal) + 2 (paternal) = **4 cousins**.  ### Answer: 4",

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step and create a family tree based on the given information.  **Alice's Immediate Family:** - Alice has **2 sisters**. This implies there are **3 children** (including Alice) in her immediate family. - However, the problem doesn't state that Alice has *only* 2 sisters, so it's possible she also has brothers.  **Maternal Side:** - Alice's mother has:   - **1 sister** who has **no children**.   - **2 brothers**. - The sister (Alice's aunt with no children) has **6 nephews and nieces**. - Since she has no children, her nephews and nieces are the children of her siblings (Alice's mother and her two brothers).    Let\u2019s let: - **B** = Number of brothers Alice has. - **Total siblings** of Alice = **2 sisters** + **B brothers** + **Alice herself** = **3 + B**.  From the aunt's perspective: - Total nephews and nieces = **6**. - These are the children of:   - Alice's mother: **3 + B** (Alice, her 2 sisters, and B brothers).   - The two brothers: Let's call the total number of their children **C**.  So, **(3 + B) + C = 6** \u2192 **C = 3 - B**.  Since the number of children (C) can't be negative, **B** must be **0**, **1**, **2**, or **3**.  **Paternal Side:** - Alice's father has:   - **1 brother** who has **2 daughters**. - This brother has **4 nephews and nieces**, which are the children of his siblings.    Assuming Alice's father has no other siblings, the nephews and nieces are: - Alice and her siblings: **3 + B**. - Since the uncle has **4** nephews and nieces, **(3 + B) = 4**, so **B = 1**.  So, Alice has **1 brother**, in addition to her **2 sisters**.  **Calculating Cousins for Alice's Sister:** - **Maternal Cousins**: Children of Alice's mother's siblings (excluding her mother).   - The aunt has no children (**0**).   - The two uncles have **C = 3 - B = 2** children. - **Paternal Cousins**: Children of Alice's father's siblings (excluding her father).   - The uncle has **2 daughters**.    **Total Cousins**: **Maternal** (**2**) + **Paternal** (**2**) = **4**.  ### Answer: 4",
