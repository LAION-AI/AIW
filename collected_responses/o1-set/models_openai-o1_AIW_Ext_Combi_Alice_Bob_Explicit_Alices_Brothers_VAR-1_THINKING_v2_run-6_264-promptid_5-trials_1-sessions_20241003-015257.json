Since she is a sister herself, the total number of girls in the family is **4 girls** (Alice + 3 sisters).  2. **Identify Bob's Brothers:**    - Bob has 6 brothers. Since he is a brother himself, the total number of boys in the family is **7 boys** (Bob + 6 brothers).  3. **Total Number of Siblings:**    - Adding the number of girls and boys together, the family has **11 children** in total (4 girls + 7 boys).  4. **Determine the Number of Brothers Alice Has:**    - Since there are **7 boys** in total, and all are Alice's brothers (as she is one of the siblings), Alice has **7 brothers**.  **Answer: 7**",

        "model_response":"We start by analyzing the given information carefully:  1. **Alice and Bob are sister and brother**, meaning they are siblings in the same family.  2. **Alice has 3 sisters**. Since people usually do not count themselves when stating the number of siblings they have, this means Alice has 3 sisters **in addition to herself**, making a total of **4 girls** in the family.  3. **Bob has 6 brothers**. Similarly, Bob has 6 brothers **excluding himself**, so including Bob, there are **7 boys** in the family.  Now, let's find out how many brothers Alice has:  - The total number of **boys** (brothers) in the family is **7**. - Since all the boys are Alice's brothers (they are in the same family), Alice has **7 brothers**.  ### Answer: 7",

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's carefully analyze and define the relationships and numbers of siblings.  1. **Define the known quantities:**    - Alice has 3 sisters.    - Bob has 6 brothers.    - Alice and Bob are sister and brother.  2. **Determine the total number of sisters and brothers:**    - Since Alice has 3 sisters, and she is one of the sisters herself, the total number of sisters is:      \\[      \\text{Total sisters} = 3 (\\text{Alice's sisters}) + 1 (\\text{Alice herself}) = 4      \\]    - Similarly, since Bob has 6 brothers, and he is one of the brothers himself, the total number of brothers is:      \\[      \\text{Total brothers} = 6 (\\text{Bob's brothers}) + 1 (\\text{Bob himself}) = 7      \\]  3. **Calculate the number of brothers Alice has:**    - Alice has all the brothers in the family as her brothers.
