        "model_response":"Let's approach this problem step by step to determine the number of cousins Alice's sister has.  Given: - Alice has 1 sister and 1 brother. - Alice's mother has 2 brothers. - Alice's mother has 1 sister who does not have children and has 6 nephews and nieces in total. - Alice's father has 2 sisters. - Alice's father has a brother who has 5 nephews and nieces in total, and 1 daughter.  Step 1: Determine the number of cousins from Alice's mother's side. - Alice's mother has 2 brothers, so their children are Alice's cousins. - The total number of nephews and nieces of Alice's mother's sister is 6, which includes Alice, her sister, and her brother. Therefore, the number of cousins from this aunt is 6 - 3 = 3. Total cousins from Alice's mother's side = 2 + 3 = 5  Step 2: Determine the number of cousins from Alice's father's side. - Alice's father has 2 sisters, so their children are Alice's cousins. - Alice's father's brother has 1 daughter, who is Alice's cousin. - The total number of nephews and nieces of Alice's father's brother is 5, which includes his own daughter. Therefore, the number of cousins from this uncle is 5 - 1 = 4. Total cousins from Alice's father's side = 2 + 4 = 6  Step 3: Calculate the total number of cousins for Alice and her sister. Total cousins = Cousins from mother's side + Cousins from father's side Total cousins = 5 + 6 = 11  Therefore, Alice and her sister have 11 cousins in total.  Double-checking the solution: - The total number of cousins is correctly calculated by adding the cousins from both sides of the family. - The number of cousins from each side is correctly determined by subtracting Alice, her sister, and her brother from the total number of nephews and nieces mentioned. - The final answer is consistent with the given information.  ### Answer: Alice's sister has 11 cousins.",
