        "model_response":"Given: - Alice has 5 male friends. - Bob has 8 female friends. - All mentioned persons are friends with each other and have no other friends aside.

So, the total group consists of: - 5 males (Bob + 4 male friends) - 8 females (Alice + 7 female friends)  Since Alice is friends with all females in the group (excluding herself), she has 7 female friends.  ### Answer: 7",

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we begin by identifying all the people involved:  - **Alice** (female) - **Bob** (male) - Alice's male friends: Since Alice has 5 male friends and Bob is male and her friend, Bob is included in these 5 male friends. Therefore, there are **4 other male friends** besides Bob. - Bob's female friends: Bob has 8 female friends. Since Alice is female and his friend, Alice is included in these 8 female friends. Therefore, there are **7 other female friends** besides Alice.  All the mentioned people are friends with each other and have no other friends outside this group. Thus, the total group consists of:  - **5 males** (Bob + 4 other males) - **8 females** (Alice + 7 other females)  Since Alice is friends with all the people in this group (except herself), the number of her female friends is the total number of females minus herself:  - **8 total females - 1 (Alice herself) = 7 female friends**  ### Answer: 7",

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we'll consider the total number of people involved and their relationships.   First, we know that: - Alice is female and has **5 male friends**. - Bob is male and has **8 female friends**. - All mentioned persons are friends with each other, and they have no other friends outside this group.   Since everyone in the group is friends with each other, and there are no other friends outside this group, we can deduce the following:  1. **Bob is one of Alice's male friends.** Since Bob is male and friends with Alice, he is included in her count of male friends. This means that besides Bob, there are **4 other male friends** (because Alice has 5 male friends in total).     2. **Alice is one of Bob's female friends.** Since Alice is female and friends with Bob, she is included in his count of female friends. This means that besides Alice, there are **7 other female friends** (because Bob has 8 female friends in total).  So the total group consists of: - 1 female (Alice) + 7 other females = **8 females**. - 1 male (Bob) + 4 other males = **5 males**.  Since Alice is friends with everyone in this group except herself, the number of her female friends is the total number of females minus herself:  **Number of Alice's female friends = 8 females - 1 (Alice herself) = 7 female friends**.  ### Answer: 7",
