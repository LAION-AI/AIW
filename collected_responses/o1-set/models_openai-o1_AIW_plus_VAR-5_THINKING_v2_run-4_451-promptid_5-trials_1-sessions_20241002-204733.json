        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step by interpreting the relationships and counting carefully.  **Alice's Immediate Family:** - Alice has **3 sisters** (implying a total of **4 daughters** including Alice). - The number of brothers in Alice's family isn't directly mentioned, so we need to deduce it from the information provided.  **Alice's Father's Side:** - Alice's father has **1 brother**, who is **Uncle_P**. - Uncle_P has **1 son**. - Uncle_P has **5 nephews and nieces**. Since nephews and nieces are the children of one's siblings, and Uncle_P has only one sibling (Alice's father), all these nephews and nieces are Alice and her siblings. - Therefore, **Alice's father must have 5 children** (since Uncle_P has 5 nephews and nieces). - We already know about **4 daughters** (Alice and her sisters), so there must be **1 son** in Alice's immediate family.    **Alice's Mother's Side:** - Alice's mother has:   - **1 sister** who is childless (let's call her **Aunt_M**).   - **2 brothers** (Uncle1_M and Uncle2_M). - Aunt_M has **6 nephews and nieces**. Since she is childless, these are the children of her siblings (Alice's mother and her two brothers). - We know Alice's mother has **5 children** (4 daughters and 1 son). - Therefore, the combined number of children that Uncle1_M and Uncle2_M have must be **1** (since 5 (mother's children) + X (uncle's children) = 6 nephews and nieces for Aunt_M).    **Counting Alice's Cousins:** - On the **maternal side**, Alice has **1 cousin** (child of her uncles). - On the **paternal side**, Alice has **1 cousin** (the son of Uncle_P). - So, **total cousins = 1 (maternal) + 1 (paternal) = 2 cousins**.  **Conclusion:**  ### Answer: 2",

        "model_response":"To solve this problem step by step, let's construct Alice's family tree based on the given information.  1. **Alice's Immediate Family:**    - Alice has **3 sisters**, so there are **4 daughters** in Alice's family.    - The problem doesn't mention any brothers, but we'll deduce the presence of a brother later based on the given information.  2. **Mother's Side of the Family:**    - Alice's mother has:      - **1 sister** (Alice's aunt) who **does not have children**.      - **2 brothers** (Alice's uncles).    - The aunt has **6 nephews and nieces**. Since she doesn't have children, these are the children of her siblings: Alice's mother and the two brothers.    - So, the total children from Alice's mother and her two brothers is **6**.    - We know Alice's mother has **4 daughters** (Alice and her sisters).    - Therefore, the two brothers must have **2 children** in total (since 6 total nephews and nieces minus the 4 daughters equals 2).      - This means each brother could have 1 child, or one brother could have 2 children while the other has none.  3. **Father's Side of the Family:**    - Alice's father has a **brother** (Alice's uncle) who has:      - **1 son** (Alice's cousin).      - **5 nephews and nieces**, who are the children of his siblings.    - Since the uncle is Alice's father's only mentioned sibling, these nephews and nieces must be the children of Alice's father.    - Therefore, Alice's father has **5 children**.      - We know about the **4 daughters**, so Alice must have **1 brother** as well (since 5 children minus 4 daughters equals 1 son).  4. **Total Number of Cousins:**    - **Maternal Cousins**: Alice has **2 cousins** from her mother's brothers.    - **Paternal Cousins**: Alice has **1 cousin** from her father's brother.    - Therefore, the total number of cousins Alice (and her sisters) have is **2 (maternal) + 1 (paternal) = 3**.  However, on careful re-examination, we realize that the two nephews\/nieces from the maternal side are combined into one child (since 2 uncles share 2 children), and the paternal side provides one cousin. Therefore, Alice has:  - **1 cousin** from her mother's side. - **1 cousin** from her father's side.  So, Alice's sister has **2 cousins**.  ### Answer: 2",

        "model_response":"To determine the number of cousins Alice's sister has, let's break down the information provided step by step.  **Alice's Family:** - Alice has 3 sisters, so there are 4 daughters. - From the information about Alice's father's brother having 5 nephews and nieces, and since Alice has 3 sisters, it's inferred that Alice also has a brother (totaling 5 children in her family).  **Mother's Side:** - Alice's mother has 1 sister (who has no children) and 2 brothers. - The aunt (mother's sister) has 6 nephews and nieces, who are the children of her siblings.    - Alice's mother's children: Alice and her 4 siblings (5 in total).    - Therefore, the 2 uncles (mother's brothers) together have 1 child (since 5 of the 6 nephews and nieces are Alice and her siblings).  **Father's Side:** - Alice's father has 1 brother who has 1 son. - This uncle has 5 nephews and nieces (Alice and her 4 siblings).  **Calculating Cousins:** - From Mother's Side: 1 cousin (child of mother's brothers). - From Father's Side: 1 cousin (uncle's son). - Total cousins: 1 (mother's side) + 1 (father's side) = 2 cousins.  However, this seems inconsistent with earlier deductions. According to the initial deductions, on the mother's side, the two uncles have a total of 2 children (since the aunt has 6 nephews and nieces and Alice's family consists of 5 children). On the father's side, the uncle has 1 son.  Therefore, the total number of cousins is: - Mother's side: 1 cousin (from uncles) - Father's side: 1 cousin (uncle's son) - Total cousins: 1 + 1 = 2 cousins.  But the problem asks for the number of cousins Alice's sister has, which should include all cousins, so we correct our calculation.  Wait, the previous deduction shows that there are 2 cousins from the mother's side (since the aunt has 6 nephews and nieces, Alice's family is 5 siblings, so 6 - 5 = 1, but since the uncles have 2 children in total, there are 2 cousins from the mother's side). Combined with the cousin from the father's side, that makes 3 cousins in total.  ### Answer: 3",
