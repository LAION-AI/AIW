We can deduce more information:    - Alice's aunt (mother's sister) has 7 nephews and nieces    - This includes Alice and her 3 siblings (4 total)    - So, Alice's mother's brothers must have 3 children in total (7 - 4 = 3)  6. On the father's side:    - Alice's uncle has 5 nephews and nieces    - This includes Alice and her 3 siblings (4 total)    - Plus his own son (1)    - So, Alice's father's sisters don't have any children (5 - 4 - 1 = 0)  7.
