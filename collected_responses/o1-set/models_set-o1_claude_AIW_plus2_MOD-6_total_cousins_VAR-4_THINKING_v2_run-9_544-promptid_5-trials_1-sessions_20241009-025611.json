These nephews and nieces come from Alice's siblings.    - **Children from Mother's Brothers:** Since the sister has 4 nephews and 2 nieces, Alice's 3 brothers have a total of 6 children (4 sons and 2 daughters).  3. **Father's Side:**    - **Father's Siblings:** 2 sisters and 1 brother.    - **Father's Brother:** Has 3 nephews and 2 nieces, and also has 1 daughter. The daughter's inclusion suggests that among the nieces, one is his own daughter. Therefore, the father\u2019s brother has a total of 5 cousins from his perspective.  4. **Total Cousins:**    - **From Mother's Side:** 6 cousins (4 nephews + 2 nieces).    - **From Father's Side:** 5 cousins (3 nephews + 2 nieces).  Adding both sides together: - **Total Cousins:** 6 (mother's side) + 5 (father's side) = **11 cousins**.  ### Answer: 11",

Alice's mother also has 1 sister who does not have children. This sister has 4 nephews and 2 nieces in total. These nephews and nieces are the children of Alice's mother's brothers (from step 2).

From Alice's mother:    - 3 sons (Alice's brothers) = 3 nephews to the mother's sister.    - 2 daughters (Alice and her sister) = 2 nieces to the mother's sister. 2. Total from Alice's mother = **3 nephews + 2 nieces** 3. The mother's sister has a total of **4 nephews + 2 nieces**.    - Therefore, the mother's brothers collectively have **1 son** (since 4 nephews - 3 nephews = 1 nephew from the brothers).  **Paternal Side:** - **Father's Siblings:**   - **Brother:**     - Has **1 daughter**.     - Has **3 nephews and 2 nieces** total.       - These are Alice and her siblings.   - **Sisters (2):** No information about their children, but since the father's brother only counts Alice's siblings as nephews and nieces, the sisters likely have no children.  **Calculating Paternal Cousins:** 1. From the father's brother:    - **1 daughter** (Alice's cousin). 2. From the father's sisters:    - **No children** (inferred from the father's brother's count of nephews and nieces).  **Total Cousins for Alice's Sister:** - **Maternal Cousin:** **1** (son of the mother's brothers). - **Paternal Cousin:** **1** (daughter of the father's brother). - **Total Cousins:** **1 + 1 = 2**  ### Answer: 2",

First, we need to identify Alice's aunts and uncles:    - From her mother's side: 2 uncles and 1 aunt    - From her father's side: 2 aunts and 1 uncle    Total: 3 uncles and 3 aunts  2. Now, let's count the children of these aunts and uncles:        Mother's side:    - We know Alice's mother's sister has no children    - We don't have information about the children of Alice's mother's brothers     Father's side:    - We know Alice's father's brother has 1 daughter    - We don't have information about the children of Alice's father's sisters  3. The key information is that Alice's father's brother has 3 nephews and 2 nieces in total.  4. We know that Alice and her siblings account for 4 of these (1 sister + 3 brothers = 4 children)  5. This means that Alice's father's brother's daughter (Alice's cousin) is the 5th niece\/nephew.  6. Therefore, Alice's father's sisters must not have any children, as all nieces and nephews are accounted for.  7. So, the only cousin we can confirm is the daughter of Alice's father's brother.  8. Alice's sister would have the same number of cousins as Alice.  Therefore, we can conclude that Alice's sister has 1 cousin.  ### Answer: 1",

First, let's identify Alice's siblings:    - Alice has 1 sister and 3 brothers    - This means Alice's parents have 5 children in total (including Alice)  2.
