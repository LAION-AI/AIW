Since she isn't counted as her own sister, this means there are **4 girls in total (Alice + 3 sisters)**.  3. **Bob has 5 brothers**. Since he isn't counted as his own brother, this means there are **6 boys in total (Bob + 5 brothers)**.  4. **Total number of children in the family** is **4 girls + 6 boys = 10 children**.  5. **Alice's brothers** are the boys in the family.

This means that, in addition to Alice herself, there are 3 other girls in the family. Therefore, the total number of girls is:    - Alice + 3 sisters = **4 girls**.  3. **Bob has 5 brothers**. This means that, in addition to Bob himself, there are 5 other boys in the family. Therefore, the total number of boys is:    - Bob + 5 brothers = **6 boys**.  4. **Total number of children in the family** is the sum of all the boys and girls:    - 4 girls + 6 boys = **10 children**.  5. **Alice's brothers** are all the boys in the family since they are her siblings.
