        "model_response":"To determine how many cousins Alice's sister has, let's break down the information step by step:  1. **Alice and Her Siblings:**    - Alice has 4 sisters, making a total of 5 children in her immediate family.  2. **Mother's Side:**    - Alice's mother has **1 sister** (maternal aunt) who **does not have children**.    - This maternal aunt has **6 nephews and nieces**. Since the aunt has no children, these nephews and nieces must come from her **2 brothers** (maternal uncles).    - Therefore, the **maternal uncles** have a combined total of **6 children** (Alice's cousins from the mother's side).  3. **Father's Side:**    - Alice's father has **1 brother** (paternal uncle).    - This paternal uncle has **5 nephews and nieces**, which are Alice and her 4 sisters, totaling **5**.    - Additionally, the paternal uncle has **1 son** of his own, who is Alice's **cousin**.  4. **Total Cousins:**    - From the **mother's side**: **6 cousins**.    - From the **father's side**: **1 cousin**.    - **Total cousins** = 6 (maternal) + 1 (paternal) = **7 cousins**.  ### Answer: 7",

        "model_response":"To determine how many cousins Alice's sister has, let's break down the family relationships step by step:  1. **Alice and Her Sisters:**    - Alice has 4 sisters, making a total of 5 daughters in the family.  2. **Mother's Side:**    - **Mother's Siblings:**      - 1 sister (aunt) who has no children.      - 2 brothers.    - **Cousins from Mother's Brothers:**      - The 2 brothers have a total of 6 nephews and nieces.      - These 6 are Alice and her 4 sisters plus possibly one more child, but since Alice and her sisters are already accounted for, it's clear that there are 6 cousins from the mother's side.  3. **Father's Side:**    - **Father's Siblings:**      - 1 brother (uncle).    - **Cousins from Father's Brother:**      - The uncle has 1 son.      - Additionally, he has 5 nephews and nieces, which are Alice and her 4 sisters.      - However, these 5 are Alice and her sisters themselves, so the only additional cousin comes from the uncle's 1 son.  4. **Total Cousins:**    - From the mother's side: 6 cousins.    - From the father's side: 1 cousin.    - **Total:** 6 + 1 = 7 cousins.  ### Answer: 7",
