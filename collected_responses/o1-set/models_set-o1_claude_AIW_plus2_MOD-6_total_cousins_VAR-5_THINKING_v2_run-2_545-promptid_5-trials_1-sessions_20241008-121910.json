Now, let's look at Alice's mother's side:    - 2 brothers    - 1 sister (who has no children)    The sister has 2 nephews and 4 nieces, which matches the 4 children in Alice's family (2 boys, 2 girls).  3. On Alice's father's side:    - 2 sisters    - 1 brother    The brother has 1 nephew and 4 nieces, plus 1 son of his own.  4. We need to count the cousins of Alice's sister. Cousins come from the children of aunts and uncles.  5. From the mother's side:    - 2 uncles, but we don't know if they have children    - 1 aunt with no children    So no confirmed cousins from this side.  6. From the father's side:    - 2 aunts, but we don't know if they have children    - 1 uncle who has 1 son    So we have 1 confirmed cousin from this side.  7.

We need to be careful about the information given about nephews and nieces:    - Mother's sister has 2 nephews and 4 nieces in total    - Father's brother has 1 nephew and 4 nieces in total     These numbers include Alice, her siblings, and her cousins, so we can't use them directly to count cousins.  4. The only definite information we have about cousins is that Alice has one cousin from her father's side (the son of her father's brother).  5. We don't have any information about children from the other aunts and uncles, so we can't assume they have any.  6. Therefore, the only cousin we can confirm is the one from Alice's father's brother.  7. Alice's sister would have the same number of cousins as Alice.

After analyzing the problem, we can conclude that: - Alice has an unknown number of cousins from her mother's side (children of her mother's 2 brothers). - Alice has an unknown number of cousins from her father's side (children of her father's 2 sisters). - Alice has 1 cousin from her father's side (the son of her father's brother).  Therefore, the total number of Alice's cousins is unknown based on the given information.  Now, the question asks about the number of cousins Alice's sister has. Since Alice and her sister share the same parents, they would have the same number of cousins.  ### Answer: The number of cousins Alice's sister has cannot be determined based on the given information. More data is needed about the children of Alice's mother's brothers and Alice's father's sisters.",

Determine the number of cousins from Alice's mother's side:    * Alice's mother has 2 brothers, but their children are not mentioned.    * Alice's mother's sister does not have children, so no cousins from her.    * The number of cousins from Alice's mother's side is unknown.  3. Determine the number of cousins from Alice's father's side:    * Alice's father has 2 sisters, but their children are not mentioned.    * Alice's father's brother has 1 son, who is Alice's cousin.    * The 1 nephew and 4 nieces mentioned for Alice's father's brother are not Alice's cousins, as they are the children of Alice's cousins.    * So, from Alice's father's side, there is 1 confirmed cousin (the son of Alice's father's brother).  4. Determine the total number of cousins:    * The number of cousins from Alice's mother's side is unknown.    * There is 1 confirmed cousin from Alice's father's side.    * The total number of cousins cannot be determined with the given information.  5. Check for any mistakes in the problem-solving process:    * The given information does not provide the number of children of Alice's mother's brothers and Alice's father's sisters.    * The nephews and nieces mentioned are not Alice's cousins, but the children of Alice's cousins.    * The problem-solving process seems correct based on the given information.  ### Answer: The total number of cousins Alice's sister has cannot be determined with the given information.

Alice's father's side: - Alice's father has 2 sisters. - The number of children of these 2 sisters is not given. - Alice's father has a brother who has 1 nephew and 4 nieces in total, and who also has 1 son. - Since the brother has 1 son, the 1 nephew and 4 nieces must be from the 2 sisters. - Therefore, Alice and her siblings have 5 cousins from their father's side.

Step 1: Identify Alice's cousins from her mother's side. - Alice's mother's brothers' children are Alice's cousins. - The total number of nephews and nieces of Alice's mother's sister is equal to the number of Alice's siblings plus the number of cousins from Alice's mother's brothers. - 2 nephews + 4 nieces = (2 sisters + 1 brother) + (number of cousins from Alice's mother's brothers) - 6 = 3 + (number of cousins from Alice's mother's brothers) - Therefore, Alice has 3 cousins from her mother's side.  Step 2: Identify Alice's cousins from her father's side. - Alice's father's sisters' children are Alice's cousins. - Alice's father's brother has 1 son, who is Alice's cousin. - The total number of nephews and nieces of Alice's father's brother is equal to the number of Alice's siblings plus the number of cousins from Alice's father's sisters. - 1 nephew + 4 nieces = (2 sisters + 1 brother) + (number of cousins from Alice's father's sisters) - 5 = 3 + (number of cousins from Alice's father's sisters) - Therefore, Alice has 2 cousins from her father's sisters.
