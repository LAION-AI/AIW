We don't know if these uncles have children, so we cannot count any cousins from this side yet.  3. Alice's mother also has 1 sister who does not have children. This aunt has 3 nephews and 4 nieces in total. Since this aunt doesn't have children, these nephews and nieces must come from her siblings (Alice's mother and her 2 brothers). We still don't know the distribution of these nephews and nieces among the siblings.  4. Alice's father has 2 sisters. These sisters are Sister A's aunts. We don't know if these aunts have children, so we cannot count any cousins from this side yet.  5. Alice's father also has a brother who has 1 nephew and 4 nieces in total, and who also has 1 son. This uncle's son is Sister A's cousin. The 1 nephew and 4 nieces must be from the uncle's siblings (Alice's father and his 2 sisters), but again, we don't know the distribution.  Double-checking: - We have identified one confirmed cousin for Sister A from her father's side. - We don't have enough information to determine the number of cousins from Alice's mother's side or from the other aunt on Alice's father's side.

From Alice's father's side:    - Her father has 2 sisters    - Her father has 1 brother  4.

The information about Alice's father's brother is crucial:    - He has 1 nephew and 4 nieces    - We know he has 1 son    - This means the other 4 children (nieces) must be from his siblings (Alice's father's sisters)  7.

Therefore, the total number of cousins we can confirm is:    5 (from father's side) + at least 3 (from mother's side) = at least 8  10.

Brother1  **Mother's Side:** - Alice's mother has:   - 2 brothers: Uncle M1 and Uncle M2   - 1 sister: Aunt M (who has no children) - Aunt M has 3 nephews and 4 nieces.   - Since Aunt M has no children, these nephews and nieces must be the children of her siblings (Mother M, Uncle M1, Uncle M2).   - From Mother M:     - Nephews: 1 (Brother1)     - Nieces: 3 (Alice and her sisters)   - Total from Mother M: 1 nephew + 3 nieces = 4   - Since Aunt M has 3 nephews and 4 nieces in total, Uncle M1 and Uncle M2 together must have:     - Nephews: 3 total - 1 from Mother M = **2 nephews**     - Nieces: 4 total - 3 from Mother M = **1 niece**   - So, between Uncle M1 and Uncle M2, there are **3 children** (2 sons and 1 daughter).  **Father's Side:** - Alice's father has:   - 2 sisters: Aunt F1 and Aunt F2   - 1 brother: Uncle F1 (who has 1 son) - Uncle F1 has 1 nephew and 4 nieces.   - From Father F:     - Nephews: 1 (Brother1)     - Nieces: 3 (Alice and her sisters)   - Total from Father F: 1 nephew + 3 nieces = 4   - Since Uncle F1 has 1 nephew and 4 nieces, and we've accounted for 1 nephew and 3 nieces from Father F, there must be 1 more niece from Aunt F1 or Aunt F2.   - So, Aunt F1 or Aunt F2 has **1 daughter**. - Uncle F1's child:   - **1 son**  **Total Cousins for Alice's Sister:** - Maternal Cousins:   - From Uncle M1 and Uncle M2: **3 cousins** (2 nephews + 1 niece) - Paternal Cousins:   - From Uncle F1: **1 cousin** (1 son)   - From Aunt F1 or Aunt F2: **1 cousin** (1 daughter) - Total cousins: **3 (maternal) + 2 (paternal) = 5 cousins**  ### Answer: 5",

We know that MS's nephews and nieces are the children of her siblings (M, MB1, MB2). From M (Alice's mother), MS has 1 nephew (B) and 3 nieces (A, S1, S2). Therefore, from MB1 and MB2, there are **2 nephews and 1 niece** (since MS has a total of 3 nephews and 4 nieces). So, on the maternal side, Alice has **3 cousins**: **2 male cousins** (sons of MB1 and MB2) and **1 female cousin** (daughter of MB1 or MB2).  **Paternal Side:** - **Alice's Father (P) has siblings:**   - **2 Sisters (PS1 and PS2)**   - **1 Brother (PB)**     - PB has **1 son** (Alice's cousin).     - PB has **1 nephew and 4 nieces**. The nephew is B (Alice's brother), the 3 nieces are A, S1, S2, and the additional niece comes from either PS1 or PS2. This means at least one of P's sisters has **1 daughter**.  So, on the paternal side, Alice has **2 cousins**: **1 male cousin** (son of PB) and **1 female cousin** (daughter of PS1 or PS2).  **Total Cousins:** - **Maternal cousins:** 3 - **Paternal cousins:** 2 - **Total cousins:** 3 + 2 = **5**  ### Answer: 5",
