        "model_response":"Let's break down the problem step by step:  1. **Understanding Relationships:**    - Alice and Bob are siblings, with Alice being the sister and Bob the brother.  2. **Alice's Siblings:**    - Alice has 3 sisters. This means there are 4 sisters in total (including Alice herself).  3. **Bob's Siblings:**    - Bob has 1 brother. This indicates there are 2 brothers in total (including Bob himself).  4. **Total Siblings:**    - Combining both, there are 4 sisters and 2 brothers, making a total of 6 siblings.  5. **Determining Alice's Brothers:**    - Since Alice is one of the sisters, her brothers are the male siblings. From step 3, there are 2 brothers in total.  **Double-Check:** - Alice has 3 sisters (4 sisters including herself). - Bob has 1 brother (2 brothers including himself). - Alice's brothers are the same as Bob's brothers, which totals 2.  ### Answer: 2",
