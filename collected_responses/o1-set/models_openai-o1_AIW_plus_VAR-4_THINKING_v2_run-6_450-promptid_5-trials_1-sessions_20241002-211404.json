        "model_response":"To solve this problem, consider the following steps: - **Alice and her sisters**: Alice has 4 sisters, making a total of 5 siblings in her immediate family. - **Maternal side**:   - Alice's mother has **1 sister** (who has no children) and **2 brothers**.   - The aunt (mother's sister) has **6 nephews and nieces**, who must be the children of the aunt's siblings since she has no children herself.   - Since Alice's mother has 5 daughters, the 2 brothers must have **only 1 child together** (because 5 daughters + 1 other child = 6 nephews and nieces). - **Paternal side**:   - Alice's father has a **brother** who has **1 son**.   - This uncle has **5 nephews and nieces**, who are the children of his siblings.   - Since Alice's father only has the one brother mentioned, and the uncle has 5 nephews and nieces, these must be Alice and her 4 sisters.    Therefore, Alice's sister has **2 cousins**: one from her maternal uncles and one from her paternal uncle.  ### Answer: 2",
