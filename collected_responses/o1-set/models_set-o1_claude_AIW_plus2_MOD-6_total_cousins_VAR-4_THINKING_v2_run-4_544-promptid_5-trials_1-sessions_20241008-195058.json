Now, let's look at the children of these aunts and uncles:    - Mother's sister: No children    - Father's brother: 1 daughter  3. We're not given direct information about the children of the other aunts and uncles, but we can deduce some information:    - Mother's sister has 4 nephews and 2 nieces in total    - Father's brother has 3 nephews and 2 nieces in total  4. We know Alice has 1 sister and 3 brothers, which accounts for 4 of the nephews\/nieces mentioned above  5. This means:    - The remaining nephews\/nieces for mother's sister are cousins to Alice    - The remaining nephews\/nieces for father's brother are also cousins to Alice  6.

Cousins from Alice's father's side:    * Alice's father has 2 sisters, so their children will be cousins to Alice and her siblings.    * We don't have information about the number of children Alice's father's sisters have.    * Alice's father's brother has 1 daughter, who is a cousin to Alice and her siblings.    * So, there is at least 1 cousin from Alice's father's side.  6. Total number of cousins for Alice's sister:    * Alice's sister will have the same number of cousins as Alice.    * The total number of known cousins is 6 from the mother's side and at least 1 from the father's side.    * Therefore, Alice's sister has at least 7 cousins.  Double-checking the solution: - The given information is correctly considered for each side of the family. - The cousins from the mother's side are accurately counted based on the provided details. - The cousins from the father's side are counted based on the available information, considering that there might be more cousins from the father's sisters, but the exact number is not given. - The total number of cousins for Alice's sister is correctly deduced from the calculated numbers.  ### Answer: Alice's sister has at least 7 cousins.",

These are Alice's maternal uncles, and their children would be Alice's cousins. However, the question doesn't provide information about whether these uncles have children or not.  3. Alice's mother also has 1 sister who does not have children. This sister has 4 nephews and 2 nieces in total. These nephews and nieces are Alice's cousins. Since Alice has 1 sister and 3 brothers, and the aunt doesn't have children, these cousins must come from Alice's father's side.  4. Alice's father has 2 sisters. Their children would be Alice's paternal cousins. However, the question doesn't provide information about whether these aunts have children or not.  5. Alice's father also has a brother who has 3 nephews and 2 nieces in total, and who also has 1 daughter. The 3 nephews and 2 nieces are Alice's paternal cousins. The daughter is also Alice's paternal cousin.  Now, let's count the total number of cousins for Alice's sister: - From point 3, Alice's sister has 4 male cousins and 2 female cousins. - From point 5, Alice's sister has 3 male cousins, 2 female cousins, and 1 more female cousin.  In total, Alice's sister has 7 male cousins (4+3) and 5 female cousins (2+2+1), which makes a total of 12 cousins.  Double-checking the solution: - The information about Alice's maternal uncles (point 2) and paternal aunts (point 4) is not relevant for the question, as we don't know if they have children. - All the cousins come from Alice's maternal aunt (point 3) and paternal uncle (point 5). - The total count of 12 cousins for Alice's sister seems correct.
