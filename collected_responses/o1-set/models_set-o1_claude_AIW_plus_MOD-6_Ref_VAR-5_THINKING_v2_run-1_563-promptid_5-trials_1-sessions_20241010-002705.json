        "model_response":"Let's think through this step-by-step:  1. First, let's identify Alice's siblings:    - Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother  2. Now, let's look at Alice's mother's side:    - Her mother has 2 brothers    - Her mother has 1 sister (Alice's aunt) who has no children    - This aunt has 6 nephews and nieces in total  3. On Alice's father's side:    - Her father has 2 sisters    - Her father has 1 brother    - This uncle has 5 nephews and nieces in total    - This uncle also has 1 son  4. To find Alice's sister's cousins, we need to count the children of Alice's aunts and uncles:    - On mother's side:       * 2 uncles, but we don't know how many children they have    - On father's side:      * 2 aunts, but we don't know how many children they have      * 1 uncle who has 1 son  5. The key information is:    - Alice's aunt (mother's sister) has 6 nephews and nieces    - Alice's uncle (father's brother) has 5 nephews and nieces  6. Let's break this down:    - The 6 nephews and nieces of Alice's aunt include Alice, her 2 sisters, and her brother (4 in total)    - This means there are 2 more, which must be cousins from her mother's brothers  7. Similarly:    - The 5 nephews and nieces of Alice's uncle include Alice, her 2 sisters, and her brother (4 in total)    - This means there is 1 more, which must be a cousin from her father's sisters  8. So, we can conclude:    - There are 2 cousins from mother's side    - There is 1 cousin from father's side    - Plus the 1 son of Alice's uncle on her father's side  9. Total cousins: 2 + 1 + 1 = 4  After careful consideration and double-checking, I can provide the final answer:  ### Answer: 4",

Now, let's look at Alice's mother's side:    - Her mother has 2 brothers    - Her mother has 1 sister with no children  3. On Alice's father's side:    - Her father has 2 sisters    - Her father has 1 brother who has 1 son  4. We need to count the cousins of Alice's sister. Alice's sister's cousins would be:    - Children of Alice's mother's brothers    - Children of Alice's father's sisters    - The son of Alice's father's brother  5. We don't know directly how many children Alice's mother's brothers or father's sisters have. But we can deduce this information:    - Alice's mother's sister has 6 nephews and nieces in total    - These 6 must include Alice and her 3 siblings (4 total)    - So, Alice's mother's brothers must have 2 children in total (6 - 4 = 2)  6. For Alice's father's side:    - Alice's father's brother has 5 nephews and nieces in total    - These 5 must include Alice and her 3 siblings (4 total)    - We know Alice's father's brother has 1 son    - So, Alice's father's sisters must have 0 children (5 - 4 - 1 = 0)  7. Counting the cousins:    - 2 from mother's brothers    - 0 from father's sisters    - 1 from father's brother  8.

Alice's mother also has 1 sister who doesn't have children but has 6 nephews and nieces in total. These nephews and nieces are Alice and her siblings, so there are no additional cousins to count here. 4.

Step 1: Determine the number of cousins from Alice's mother's side. - Alice's mother has 2 brothers, but the number of their children is not given. - Alice's mother's sister has no children. - The total number of nephews and nieces for Alice's mother's sister is 6, which includes Alice, her 2 sisters, and her brother.
