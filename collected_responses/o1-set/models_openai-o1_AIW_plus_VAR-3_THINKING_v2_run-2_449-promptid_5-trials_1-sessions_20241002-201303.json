        "model_response":"To determine how many cousins Alice's sister has, let's carefully map out Alice's family:  1. **Alice's Immediate Family**:    - Alice has **3 sisters**.

Since she has no children, these come from her siblings.    - **Alice's Mother** has **4 daughters** (Alice and her sisters).    - Therefore, the **2 brothers** have a combined **3 children** (since 7 nephews and nieces - 4 from Alice's mother = 3 from the brothers).    - **Maternal Cousins**: **3**  3. **Paternal Side**:    - **Alice's Father** has:      - **A brother** (Uncle B) who has **1 son**.      - Uncle B has **5 nephews and nieces**.

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:  **Alice's Family:** - Alice has **3 sisters**. This means there are **4 daughters** in Alice's immediate family. We need to check if there are any brothers.  **From Alice's Father\u2019s Side:** - Alice's **father** has a **brother** who has **5 nephews and nieces in total** and **1 son**. - The only siblings of Alice's father's brother (the uncle) are Alice's father. Thus, the nephews and nieces are Alice and her siblings. - Since the uncle has **5 nephews and nieces**, Alice's father must have **5 children**. - We already know about Alice and her 3 sisters, so there must be **1 brother** as well. - The uncle has **1 son**, so from her father's side, Alice's sister has **1 cousin**.  **From Alice's Mother\u2019s Side:** - Alice's **mother** has:   - **1 sister who does not have children**.   - **2 brothers**. - The childless sister has **7 nephews and nieces**. These are the children of her siblings (Alice's mother and the two brothers). - Alice's mother has **5 children** (Alice, her 3 sisters, and 1 brother). - That leaves **2 brothers** to have the remaining **2 nephews\/nieces** (since 7 total nephews\/nieces - 5 from Alice's mother = 2). - Therefore, the **2 brothers have 2 children** collectively. - From her mother's side, Alice's sister has **2 cousins** (children of her uncles).  **Total Cousins:** - From father's side: **1 cousin**. - From mother's side: **2 cousins**. - **Total cousins**: **1 + 2 = 3**.  Wait, this contradicts our initial total of 4 cousins calculated earlier. Let's double-check our calculation.  Actually, the childless sister has **7 nephews and nieces**, and Alice's mother has **5 children**, so the brothers collectively have **2 children**, not 3 as previously thought.  Thus, the total cousins from the mother's side are **2**, not 3.  Therefore, the total number of cousins that Alice's sister has is **1 (father's side) + 2 (mother's side) = 3 cousins**.  ### Answer: 3",
