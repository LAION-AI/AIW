Let's cross-check with the information about nephews and nieces:    - Mother's sister has 2 nephews and 4 nieces    - Father's brother has 3 nephews and 2 nieces  4. We know Alice has 1 sister and 1 brother, which accounts for 2 of the nephews\/nieces mentioned.  5. The remaining nephews and nieces must be Alice and her siblings:    - For mother's sister: 2 (Alice and her sister) of the 4 nieces, and 1 (Alice's brother) of the 2 nephews    - For father's brother: 2 (Alice and her sister) of the 2 nieces, and 1 (Alice's brother) of the 3 nephews  6. This information confirms that there are no other cousins besides the 1 daughter of Alice's paternal uncle.  7.
