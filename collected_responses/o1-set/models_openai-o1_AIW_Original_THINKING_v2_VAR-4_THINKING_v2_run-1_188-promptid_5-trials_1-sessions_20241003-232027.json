        "model_response":"To solve this problem carefully step by step:  1. **Determine the total number of siblings:**    - Alice has **4 brothers**.    - Alice has **1 sister** (other than herself).    - So, including Alice herself, there are:      - **2 sisters** (Alice and her sister).      - **4 brothers**.    - **Total siblings**: \\(2 \\text{ sisters} + 4 \\text{ brothers} = 6 \\) children in the family.  2. **Find out how many sisters each brother has:**    - Each brother cannot be his own sibling, so we exclude him when counting siblings.    - Number of sisters per brother:      - There are **2 sisters** (Alice and her sister).    - Therefore, **each brother has 2 sisters**.  ### Answer: 2",

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's carefully break down the family relationships:  1. **Alice has 4 brothers**: So there are 4 boys in the family. 2. **Alice has 1 sister**: This means Alice has one sister **in addition to herself**.  This gives us a total of 2 girls (Alice and her sister) and 4 boys (the brothers), making **6 siblings in total**.  Now, the question is: **How many sisters does Alice's brother have?**  - Each brother has:   - **Brothers**: 3 (since he doesn't count himself)   - **Sisters**: 2 (Alice and her sister)  **Therefore, each of Alice's brothers has 2 sisters.**  ### Answer: 2",
