Double-checking the solution: - The total number of cousins for Alice's sister matches the total number of cousins for Alice and her brother, as they all share the same cousins. - The information about Alice's mother's sister not having children and Alice's father's brother's total nephews and nieces is consistent with the calculated number of cousins.  ### Answer: Alice's sister has 6 cousins.",

Given: - Alice has 1 sister and 1 brother. - Alice's mother has 2 brothers. - Alice's mother has 1 sister who does not have children and has 6 nephews and nieces in total. - Alice's father has 2 sisters. - Alice's father has a brother who has 5 nephews and nieces in total and 1 daughter.  Step 1: Determine the number of cousins from Alice's mother's side. - Alice's mother's brothers' children are Alice's cousins. - The total number of Alice's mother's nephews and nieces is 6. - Since Alice's mother's sister doesn't have children, all 6 nephews and nieces are from her 2 brothers. - Therefore, Alice and her siblings have 6 cousins from their mother's side.  Step 2: Determine the number of cousins from Alice's father's side. - Alice's father's siblings' children are Alice's cousins. - Alice's father's brother has 1 daughter, who is Alice's cousin. - The total number of Alice's father's nephews and nieces is 5. - Since Alice's father's brother has 1 daughter, the remaining 4 nephews and nieces are from his 2 sisters. - Therefore, Alice and her siblings have 1 + 4 = 5 cousins from their father's side.  Step 3: Calculate the total number of cousins Alice and her siblings have. - Total cousins = Cousins from mother's side + Cousins from father's side - Total cousins = 6 + 5 = 11  Step 4: Confirm that Alice's sister has the same number of cousins as Alice. - Alice's sister is one of the three siblings (Alice, her sister, and her brother). - All three siblings have the same cousins. - Therefore, Alice's sister has the same number of cousins as Alice, which is 11.

From Alice's mother's side:    - Alice's mother has 2 brothers    - Alice's mother has 1 sister (who has no children)  3. From Alice's father's side:    - Alice's father has 2 sisters    - Alice's father has 1 brother (who has 1 daughter)  4. Now, let's count the cousins:    - From mother's side:      * Mother's 2 brothers: We don't know how many children they have    - From father's side:      * Father's 2 sisters: We don't know how many children they have      * Father's brother: We know he has 1 daughter  5. Additional information:    - Alice's mother's sister (aunt) has 6 nephews and nieces in total    - Alice's father's brother (uncle) has 5 nephews and nieces in total  6. Let's analyze:    - The 6 nephews and nieces of Alice's aunt include Alice, her sister, her brother, and 3 others    - The 5 nephews and nieces of Alice's uncle include Alice, her sister, her brother, and 2 others  7. Conclusion:    - From mother's side: 3 cousins    - From father's side: 2 cousins + 1 known cousin (daughter of father's brother) = 3 cousins  8. Total cousins:    3 (mother's side) + 3 (father's side) = 6 cousins  Double-checking: This seems consistent with all the information provided and doesn't contradict any given facts.  ### Answer: 6",

        "model_response":"Let's approach this step-by-step:  1. First, let's identify Alice's immediate family:    - Alice has 1 sister and 1 brother    - So, Alice's parents have 3 children in total  2. Now, let's look at Alice's mother's side:    - Alice's mother has 2 brothers    - Alice's mother has 1 sister who has no children    - The sister has 6 nephews and nieces in total  3. Alice's father's side:    - Alice's father has 2 sisters    - Alice's father has 1 brother    - This brother has 5 nephews and nieces in total    - This brother has 1 daughter  4. To find Alice's sister's cousins, we need to count the children of Alice's aunts and uncles:     From mother's side:    - 2 uncles: We don't know how many children they have     From father's side:    - 2 aunts: We don't know how many children they have    - 1 uncle: We know he has 1 daughter  5. The only definite information we have about cousins is the 1 daughter of Alice's paternal uncle.  6. We might be tempted to use the information about nephews and nieces, but this is tricky:    - The 6 nephews and nieces of Alice's maternal aunt include Alice and her siblings    - The 5 nephews and nieces of Alice's paternal uncle also include Alice and her siblings  7. Therefore, we can only be certain about 1 cousin (the daughter of Alice's paternal uncle).  Double-checking this reasoning, we confirm that there's not enough information to determine any other cousins with certainty.  ### Answer: 1",

        "model_response":"Let's think through this step by step:  1. We need to count Alice's cousins, which would be the same as Alice's sister's cousins.  2. Cousins come from aunts and uncles, so we need to look at Alice's parents' siblings.  3. From Alice's mother's side:    - Mother has 2 brothers    - Mother has 1 sister (but she doesn't have children)  4. From Alice's father's side:    - Father has 2 sisters    - Father has 1 brother, who has 1 daughter  5. Now, let's count the children of these aunts and uncles:    - Mother's 2 brothers: We don't know how many children they have    - Mother's sister: No children    - Father's 2 sisters: We don't know how many children they have    - Father's brother: We know he has 1 daughter  6. The only definite cousin we can count is the 1 daughter of Alice's father's brother.  7. We're told that Alice's father's brother has 5 nephews and nieces in total. This includes:    - Alice    - Alice's sister    - Alice's brother    That's 3, so there must be 2 more, but we don't know if they're Alice's cousins or other nephews\/nieces of this uncle.  8. We're also told that Alice's mother's sister (who has no children) has 6 nephews and nieces. This includes:    - Alice    - Alice's sister    - Alice's brother    That's 3, so there must be 3 more, which would be Alice's cousins from her mother's side.  9. Adding it all up:    - 1 definite cousin (father's brother's daughter)    - 3 cousins from mother's side        Total: 4 cousins  Double-checking: This answer seems consistent with the information given. We can't determine more cousins with certainty based on the information provided.  ### Answer: 4",

Now, let's count the cousins:    - From mother's side:      * We know Alice's aunt doesn't have children      * We don't have information about children of the 2 uncles    - From father's side:      * We know one uncle has 1 daughter      * We don't have information about children of the 2 aunts  3. The key information is about Alice's father's brother:    * He has 5 nephews and nieces in total    * He has 1 daughter  4. Let's break down these 5 nephews and nieces:    * 1 is his own daughter    * The other 4 must be his siblings' children  5. We know Alice and her siblings account for 3 of these (Alice, her sister, and her brother)  6. This means there is 1 more cousin (4 - 3 = 1)  7. So, the total number of cousins:    * 1 (uncle's daughter from father's side)    * 1 (additional cousin we deduced)    * Total: 2 cousins  8.
