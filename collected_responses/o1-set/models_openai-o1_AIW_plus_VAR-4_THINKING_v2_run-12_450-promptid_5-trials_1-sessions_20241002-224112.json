        "model_response":"To determine the number of cousins Alice's sister has, let's delve into the family relationships step by step.  **Alice's Siblings:** - Alice has 4 sisters, so in total, there are 5 siblings (Alice and her 4 sisters).  **Maternal Side (Alice's Mother's Family):** - Alice's mother has:   - 1 sister (childless).   - 2 brothers.  - The childless aunt (mother's sister) has **6 nephews and nieces**. These are the children of her siblings, which include:   - Alice's mother (who has 5 children).   - The two brothers.  - Since Alice's mother has 5 children, the two brothers together must have **1 child** (since 5 + 1 = 6 nephews and nieces).  - Therefore, Alice and her sisters have **1 cousin on their mother's side**.  **Paternal Side (Alice's Father's Family):** - Alice's father has:   - 1 brother.  - The father's brother has **1 son**.    - The father's brother has **5 nephews and nieces**, who would be the children of his siblings.  - Since he has only one sibling (Alice's father), and Alice's father has 5 children (Alice and her sisters), these are the 5 nephews and nieces.  - Therefore, Alice and her sisters have **1 cousin on their father's side**.  **Total Cousins:** - Maternal cousins: 1 - Paternal cousins: 1 - Total cousins = **1 + 1 = 2**  ### Answer: 2",

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's break down Alice's family structure step by step:  1. **Alice's Immediate Family**:    - Alice has **4 sisters**, so there are **5 daughters** (including Alice) in her family.    - No mention of any brothers, so it's assumed there are none.  2. **Maternal Side (Mother's Family)**:    - Alice's mother has:      - **1 sister** who is **childless**.      - **2 brothers**.    - The childless sister has **6 nephews and nieces**. Since she doesn't have her own children, these are the children of her siblings (Alice's mother and her two brothers).    - Alice's mother has **5 daughters** (Alice and her sisters).    - Therefore, the two brothers must have **1 child** between them (since 6 nephews and nieces - 5 from Alice's mother = 1 from the brothers).    - So, on the maternal side, Alice and her sisters have **1 cousin**.  3. **Paternal Side (Father's Family)**:    - Alice's father has **1 brother** who has:      - **1 son** (Alice's cousin).      - **5 nephews and nieces**, who are Alice and her sisters (since no other siblings are mentioned, and the count matches the 5 daughters).    - Therefore, on the paternal side, Alice and her sisters have **1 cousin**.  4. **Total Cousins**:    - Maternal cousins: **1**    - Paternal cousins: **1**    - **Total cousins**: **1 + 1 = 2**  **Conclusion**:  ### Answer: 2",
