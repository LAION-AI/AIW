        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's reconstruct the social network step by step:  1. **Alice's Friends**: Alice has 4 female friends (let's call them F1, F2, F3, F4) and 1 male friend (M).  2. **Friendship Among Friends**: All of Alice's friends are friends with each other. That means:    - M is friends with F1, F2, F3, and F4.    - F1 is friends with F2, F3, F4, and M.    - And so on for each of Alice's friends.  3. **No Other Friends**: The friends have no other friends aside from each other *and* Alice.  4. **Alice's Role**: Since Alice is friends with all of them, and they have no other friends besides each other and Alice, Alice is included in their circle of friends.  5. **M's Female Friends**:    - M is friends with F1, F2, F3, F4 (the 4 female friends).    - M is also friends with Alice (who is female).    - Therefore, M has a total of **5 female friends**.  ### Answer: 5",
