This means every person is friends with the other 8 people.    - **They have no other friends aside**, indicating they only have friendships within this group.  4. **Determine the Number of Female Friends for a Male Friend**:    - Pick any male friend (say, M1).    - M1 is friends with:      - **Alice** (female)      - **F1 to F5** (5 female friends)      - **M2 and M3** (the other 2 male friends)    - So, the **total number of female friends M1 has is 6** (Alice + 5 female friends).  5. **Conclusion**:    - Each male friend has **6 female friends** within this group.  ### Answer: 6",

        "model_response":"In this problem, we are given the following information:  - Alice has 5 female friends and 3 male friends. - All of Alice's friends are friends with each other. - They have no other friends besides this group.  Let's consider the total group of friends, which includes Alice, her 5 female friends, and her 3 male friends, making a total of 9 people.  Since \"they all are friends with each other,\" every person in this group is friends with every other person. This means that each male friend is friends with:  - Alice (who is female) - The 5 female friends - The other 2 male friends  Therefore, each male friend has:  - 1 (Alice) + 5 (female friends) = 6 female friends  **### Answer: 6**",

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's carefully analyze the information given:  1. **Alice has 5 female friends and 3 male friends.** 2. **They all are friends with each other and have no other friends aside.**  From point 1, Alice herself is a female, so including her, there are a total of **6 females** (Alice + 5 female friends) and **3 males** (Alice's male friends).  Point 2 tells us that everyone in this group is friends with one another \u2014 this forms a complete group of friends with no other connections outside.  So, each male friend of Alice is friends with:  - **All the females**, which includes Alice and her 5 female friends \u2014 that's **6 females**. - **All the males**, including himself, but since the question asks about female friends, we focus only on the females.  Therefore, **each male friend of Alice has 6 female friends**.  ### Answer: 6",
