        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's analyze the information step by step:  1. **Alice has 3 sisters**: This means there are 3 girls besides Alice in the family. Including Alice herself, there are **4 sisters**.  2. **Bob has 6 brothers**: This means there are 6 boys besides Bob in the family. Including Bob himself, there are **7 brothers**.  3. **Total number of siblings**: Adding the number of sisters and brothers together, the family has **4 sisters + 7 brothers = 11 children** in total.  4. **Number of brothers Alice has**: Since Alice is one of the sisters, the remaining siblings are her brothers. So, Alice has **11 total siblings - 4 sisters = 7 brothers**.  ### Answer: 7",
