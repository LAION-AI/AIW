The children of these brothers will be Alice's sister's cousins.    * However, the number of children of Alice's mother's brothers is not mentioned. We cannot determine the number of cousins from this information.  3. Alice's mother has 1 sister who does not have children.

We're also told that Alice's mother's sister has 4 nephews and 2 nieces in total.    - These must also be Alice, her sister, and her brothers    - This confirms that Alice and her siblings are the only children in her mother's side of the family as well  5. Therefore, the only cousin we can confirm is the daughter of Alice's father's brother.  Double-checking: - We've accounted for all the information given - We've confirmed that Alice and her siblings are the only children on both sides of the family, except for the one cousin mentioned  Therefore, Alice's sister has only one cousin.  ### Answer: 1",

        "model_response":"Let's think through this step-by-step:  1. First, let's identify Alice's siblings:    - Alice has 1 sister    - Alice has 3 brothers    So, Alice's parents have 5 children in total (including Alice)  2. Now, let's look at Alice's mother's side:    - Alice's mother has 2 brothers    - Alice's mother has 1 sister who doesn't have children  3. Alice's father's side:    - Alice's father has 2 sisters    - Alice's father has 1 brother  4. Now, let's count the cousins:        From mother's side:    - Mother's sister has no children    - Mother's 2 brothers: We don't have direct information about their children, but we know the aunt (mother's sister) has 4 nephews and 2 nieces. These must be from the mother's brothers.    So, from mother's side: 4 + 2 = 6 cousins     From father's side:    - Father's brother has 1 daughter    - Father's 2 sisters: We don't have direct information about their children, but we know the uncle (father's brother) has 3 nephews and 2 nieces. These must be from the father's sisters.    So, from father's side: 1 + 3 + 2 = 6 cousins  5. Total cousins: 6 + 6 = 12  6. Double-checking:    - The numbers add up correctly    - We've accounted for all aunts and uncles mentioned    - The information about nephews and nieces corroborates our count  Therefore, Alice's sister has 12 cousins.  ### Answer: 12",

        "model_response":"Let's think through this step by step:  1. First, we need to identify Alice's aunts and uncles:    - From her mother's side: 2 uncles and 1 aunt    - From her father's side: 2 aunts and 1 uncle  2. Now, we need to determine which of these aunts and uncles have children, as these children would be Alice's cousins:     - Mother's side:      - The aunt doesn't have children (stated in the problem)      - We don't have information about the uncles' children     - Father's side:      - One uncle has 1 daughter (stated in the problem)      - We don't have information about the aunts' children  3. We're told that Alice's father's brother (uncle) has 3 nephews and 2 nieces in total.    - Alice and her siblings account for 4 of these (1 sister + 3 brothers)    - This leaves 1 additional nephew or niece, which is likely the daughter mentioned  4. Therefore, the only cousin we can confirm is the 1 daughter of Alice's paternal uncle.  5. The question asks about Alice's sister's cousins. Since Alice and her sister share the same parents, they have the same cousins.  6. Double-checking: We don't have enough information to determine if Alice's other aunts and uncles (except for the mother's sister) have children, so we can't include any potential cousins from them.  Therefore, based on the given information, we can only confirm one cousin.  ### Answer: 1",
