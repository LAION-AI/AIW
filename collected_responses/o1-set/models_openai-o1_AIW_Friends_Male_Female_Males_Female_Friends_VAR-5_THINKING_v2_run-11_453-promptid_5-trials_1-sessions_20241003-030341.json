        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's carefully analyze the information provided:  1. **Alice's Friends**: Alice has 2 male friends (let's call them **M1** and **M2**) and 3 female friends (let's call them **F1**, **F2**, and **F3**).  2. **Friendship Among Them**: \"They all are friends with each other\" suggests that **Alice** and her 5 friends form a group where every person is friends with every other person in the group. In other words, they're all connected in a fully connected friendship network (a clique) of 6 people.  3. **No Other Friends**: They \"have no other friends aside,\" meaning they don't have any friends outside of this group of 6 people.  4. **Male Friend's Female Friends**: We're asked about a male friend of Alice (either **M1** or **M2**). Since both are in the same situation, let's consider **M1**.  **Counting M1's Female Friends**:  - **Alice**: Since **M1** is a friend of Alice, and Alice is female, she counts as one female friend. - **F1**, **F2**, **F3**: These are Alice's female friends, and since everyone in the group is friends with each other, **M1** is also friends with them.  **Total Female Friends for M1**: 1 (Alice) + 3 (F1, F2, F3) = **4 female friends**.  ### Answer: 4",

Alice has a total of **5 friends**: **2 male friends** and **3 female friends**. 2. **They all are friends with each other**, and they **have no other friends aside**.   This implies that the social group consists of **6 people**: **Alice** + **5 friends**. All **6 people** are friends with one another.  When focusing on one of Alice's **male friends**, his friends within this group are: - **Alice** (female) - The **other male friend** - **3 female friends** of Alice  Since we're being asked, **\"How many female friends does a male friend of Alice have?\"**, we count the number of female friends the male friend has within this group.  Total female friends of the male friend: 1. **Alice** 2. **Female Friend 1** 3. **Female Friend 2** 4. **Female Friend 3**  Therefore, the male friend has **4 female friends**.  ### Answer: 4",
