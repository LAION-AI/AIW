Alice's mother also has 1 sister who does not have children. This aunt has 2 nephews and 4 nieces in total. These nieces and nephews are Alice's cousins, so Alice and her siblings have 6 cousins from their mother's side (2 nephews + 4 nieces).  4.

Now, let's look at the information about children:    - Alice's mother's sister has no children    - Alice's father's brother has 1 daughter  3.

We don't have direct information about children from:    - Alice's mother's 2 brothers    - Alice's father's 2 sisters  6. However, we can deduce some information:    - Alice's father's brother has 3 nephews and 2 nieces in total    - Alice, her sister, and her brother account for 3 of these (2 nieces and 1 nephew)    - This means the other 2 nephews must be cousins  7.

Now, let's look at the children of these aunts and uncles:        Mother's side:    - The aunt has no children    - We don't have information about the uncles' children     Father's side:    - One uncle has 1 daughter (explicitly stated)    - We don't have information about the aunts' children  3. We're told that Alice's father's brother (uncle) has 3 nephews and 2 nieces in total.     4. These nephews and nieces must include:    - Alice    - Alice's sister    - Alice's brother    - The uncle's own daughter (Alice's cousin)  5. So, out of the 5 nephews\/nieces mentioned, 4 are accounted for. This means there is 1 more cousin.  6. We're also told about Alice's mother's sister (aunt) having 2 nephews and 4 nieces.    These must include:    - Alice    - Alice's sister    - Alice's brother    - The cousin from father's side we identified earlier  7.

Therefore, the total number of cousins is 4.  10. Since the question asks about Alice's sister's cousins, and Alice and her sister would have the same cousins, the answer remains 4.  ### Answer: 4",
