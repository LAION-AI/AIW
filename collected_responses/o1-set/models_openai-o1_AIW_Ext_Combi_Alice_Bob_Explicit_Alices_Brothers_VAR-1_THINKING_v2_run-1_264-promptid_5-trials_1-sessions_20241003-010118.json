        "model_response":"To determine how many brothers Alice has, we can analyze the information step by step.  1. **Alice has 3 sisters.** This means there are 4 girls in total, including Alice herself. 2. **Bob has 6 brothers.** Including Bob himself, this means there are 7 boys in total. 3. **Total number of children in the family** is the sum of all the boys and girls: \\( 4 \\text{ (girls)} + 7 \\text{ (boys)} = 11 \\text{ children} \\). 4. **Alice's brothers** are all the boys in the family since they share the same parents. 5. Therefore, **Alice has 7 brothers**.  ### Answer: 7",

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of siblings in the family and then find out how many brothers Alice has.  **Step 1: Determine the number of girls (sisters) in the family.** - Alice has 3 sisters. This means there are 3 sisters **besides** Alice. - So, the total number of girls is \\( 3 + 1 = 4 \\) (including Alice herself).  **Step 2: Determine the number of boys (brothers) in the family.** - Bob has 6 brothers. This means there are 6 brothers **besides** Bob. - So, the total number of boys is \\( 6 + 1 = 7 \\) (including Bob himself).  **Step 3: Determine the total number of siblings in the family.** - Total siblings \\( = \\) total girls \\( + \\) total boys \\( = 4 + 7 = 11 \\).  **Step 4: Find out how many brothers Alice has.** - Since Alice is one of the 4 girls, her brothers are the remaining siblings. - So, the number of brothers Alice has is \\( 11 \\) total siblings \\( - 1 \\) (Alice herself) \\( - 3 \\) sisters \\( = 7 \\) brothers.  ### Answer: 7",
