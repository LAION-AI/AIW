        "model_response":"Let's think through this step-by-step:  1. First, let's identify Alice's siblings:    - Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother  2.

To find Alice's sister's cousins, we need to count the children of Alice's aunts and uncles:    - On mother's side:       * 2 uncles, but we don't know if they have children    - On father's side:      * 2 aunts, but we don't know if they have children      * 1 uncle who has 1 son  5. The only cousin we can confirm is the son of Alice's paternal uncle  6. Double-checking:    - We can't assume any other cousins based on the information given    - The information about nephews and nieces doesn't help us determine additional cousins  Therefore, we can only confirm one cousin for Alice's sister.  ### Answer: 1",

We know that Alice's father's brother has 1 nephew and 4 nieces in total.     The nephew is likely Alice's brother, and the nieces are Alice and her two sisters.  4. We also know that Alice's mother's sister has 2 nephews and 4 nieces in total.    These are likely the same children: Alice, her 2 sisters, and 1 brother.  5. The only cousin we can confirm is the son of Alice's father's brother.  6. We don't have information about children from Alice's other aunts and uncles, so we can't assume they have any.  7. Alice's sister would have the same cousins as Alice.  Therefore, based on the information given, we can only confirm one cousin.  ### Answer: 1",

Therefore, we can only be certain about 1 cousin.  8. Since the question asks about Alice's sister's cousins, and Alice and her sister share the same cousins, the answer remains 1.  ### Answer: 1",
