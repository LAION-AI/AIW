        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's break down the family relationships step by step.  **1. Alice's Immediate Family:** - Alice has **2 sisters**, so there are at least **3 children** in her immediate family (Alice and her 2 sisters). - We don't know if Alice has any brothers.  **2. Maternal Side:** - **Alice's mother** has:   - **1 sister** who has **no children**.   - **2 brothers**. - The aunt (mother's sister with no children) has **6 nephews and nieces**. These are the children of her siblings (Alice's mother and her 2 brothers). - Therefore, the total number of children among Alice's mother and her two brothers is **6**.  Since Alice's mother has at least **3 children** (Alice and her 2 sisters), the two brothers must have **3 children** between them to total **6 nephews and nieces**: - **Children of maternal uncles:** **3 children**.  **3. Paternal Side:** - **Alice's father** has:   - **1 brother** who has **2 daughters**.   - The uncle has **5 nephews and nieces**. These are the children of his siblings (excluding himself). - Therefore, the total number of children among Alice's father and any other siblings is **5**.  Since Alice's father has at least **3 children** (Alice and her 2 sisters), there must be another sibling who has **2 children** to total **5 nephews and nieces**: - **Children of another paternal sibling:** **2 children**.    **4. Counting Alice's Sister's Cousins:** - **Maternal cousins** (children of maternal uncles): **3 children**. - **Paternal cousins**:   - **Children of paternal uncle:** **2 daughters**.   - **Children of another paternal sibling:** **2 children**.   - Total paternal cousins: **2 + 2 = 4 children**.  **5. Total Cousins:** - **Total cousins** = **Maternal cousins** + **Paternal cousins** = **3 + 4 = 7 cousins**.  ### Answer:   7 cousins",
