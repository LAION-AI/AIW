Alice's father has 2 sisters.    - These 2 sisters' children are Alice's cousins.    - However, the number of their children is not provided. 5. Alice's father has a brother who has 1 nephew and 4 nieces in total, and who also has 2 sons.    - The 2 sons are Alice's cousins.    - The 1 nephew and 4 nieces are the brother's grandchildren, not Alice's cousins.    - As mentioned in step 3, the 1 nephew and 2 of the nieces are the children of Alice's mother's sister.  In summary: - Alice's cousins from her mother's side: unknown number - Alice's cousins from her father's side: 2 (her father's brother's sons) - The total number of Alice's cousins cannot be determined due to insufficient information.  Therefore, the number of cousins Alice's sister has is the same as the number of cousins Alice has, which is also undetermined.  ### Answer: The number of cousins Alice's sister has cannot be determined based on the given information.",

Alice's mother's sister has no children, so she doesn't contribute to the number of Alice's cousins. 4. Alice's father has 2 sisters. The children of these sisters are Alice's cousins. 5. Alice's father has a brother who has 2 sons. These sons are Alice's cousins.  Now, let's count the total number of Alice's cousins: - Alice's mother's brothers: 2 nephews and 4 nieces, so 6 cousins in total. - Alice's father's sisters: The number of their children is not mentioned, so we can't count them. - Alice's father's brother: 2 sons, so 2 cousins in total.  The total number of Alice's cousins that we can count is 6 + 2 = 8.  Now, let's consider Alice's sister: - Alice's sister has the same cousins as Alice, so she has at least 8 cousins. - However, we don't know the number of children Alice's father's sisters have, so there might be more cousins.  Double-checking the steps, the reasoning seems correct. We can't determine the exact number of Alice's sister's cousins due to the missing information about Alice's father's sisters' children.  ### Answer: Alice's sister has at least 8 cousins, but the exact number cannot be determined based on the given information.",

We don't have enough information to determine the number of cousins from this side.  Step 2: Determine the number of cousins from Alice's mother's sister. - Alice's mother's sister does not have children, so there are no cousins from this side.  Step 3: Determine the number of cousins from Alice's father's sisters. - Alice's father has 2 sisters, but their children are not mentioned. We don't have enough information to determine the number of cousins from this side.  Step 4: Determine the number of cousins from Alice's father's brother. - Alice's father's brother has 2 sons, who are cousins to Alice and her siblings.  Step 5: Verify the total number of cousins for Alice's sister. - Based on the given information, we can only determine that Alice's sister has 2 cousins from her father's brother.
