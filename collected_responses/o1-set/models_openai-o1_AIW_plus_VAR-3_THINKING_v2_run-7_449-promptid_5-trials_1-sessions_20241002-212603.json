        "model_response":"To solve this problem step by step:  1. **Alice's Siblings**:    - Alice has 3 sisters. There is no mention of any brothers, but later we deduce that she likely has a brother as well.  2. **Maternal Side**:    - **Alice's Mother's Siblings**: Her mother has 1 sister (who has no children) and 2 brothers.    - **Nephews and Nieces**: The sister who has no children has 7 nephews and nieces. Since she has no children herself, these are the children of her siblings (Alice's mother and her two brothers).    - **Calculating Cousins on Maternal Side**:      - Alice's mother has 4 children (Alice and her 3 sisters).      - Therefore, the two maternal uncles must have a total of \\(7 - 4 = 3\\) children.      - So, on her mother's side, Alice's sister has **3 cousins**.  3. **Paternal Side**:    - **Alice's Father's Siblings**: Her father has a brother who has 1 son.    - **Nephews and Nieces**: This uncle has 5 nephews and nieces. These are the children of his siblings.    - **Calculating Cousins on Paternal Side**:      - Since the uncle has 5 nephews and nieces and only Alice's father is mentioned as his sibling, Alice's father must have 5 children.      - Given that Alice has 3 sisters, this suggests Alice also has 1 brother (making a total of 5 children).      - So, on her father's side, Alice's sister has **1 cousin** (the son of her father's brother).  4. **Total Number of Cousins**:    - **Maternal Cousins**: 3    - **Paternal Cousins**: 1    - **Total Cousins**: \\(3 + 1 = 4\\)  ### Answer: 4",

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given step by step.  1. **Alice's Family**:    - Alice has **3 sisters**, so there are **4** daughters in Alice's immediate family.    - From the information about her father's brother, we can deduce that Alice's father has **5 children** (since his brother has **5 nephews and nieces**, which are Alice and her siblings). Therefore, Alice must also have **1 brother**.  2. **Mother's Side**:    - Alice's mother has **1 sister** who is childless and **2 brothers**.    - The childless aunt has **7 nephews and nieces**. These are the children of her siblings.    - Alice's mother has **5 children** (Alice, her 3 sisters, and 1 brother), so the **2 brothers together have 2 children** (since \\(7 - 5 = 2\\)).    - Therefore, Alice has **2 cousins** on her mother's side.  3. **Father's Side**:    - Alice's father has **1 brother**.    - This brother has **1 son**.    - The uncle has **5 nephews and nieces** (Alice and her siblings).    - Therefore, Alice has **1 cousin** on her father's side.  4. **Total Cousins**:    - Adding up the cousins from both sides: \\(2 \\text{ (maternal)} + 1 \\text{ (paternal)} = 3\\).  ---  ### Answer: 3",
