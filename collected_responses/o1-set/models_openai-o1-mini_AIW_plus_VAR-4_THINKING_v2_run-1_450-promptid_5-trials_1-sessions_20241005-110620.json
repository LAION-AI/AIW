        "model_response":"Let's break down the problem step by step to determine how many cousins Alice's sister has.  **1. Alice's Immediate Family:** - Alice has **4 sisters**, making a total of **5 daughters** in the family.  **2. Mother's Side:** - **Mother's Siblings:**   - **1 sister (maternal aunt)** who **does not have children**.   - **2 brothers (maternal uncles)** who collectively have **6 nephews and nieces**. - Since the maternal aunt has no children, all **6 nephews and nieces** come from the **2 maternal uncles**.    **3. Father's Side:** - **Father's Sibling:**   - **1 brother (paternal uncle)** who has:     - **1 son** of his own.     - **5 nephews and nieces** in total. - The **5 nephews and nieces** include the children from other siblings. Since the father has only **1 brother**, the **5 nephews and nieces** must come from the **father's side**, likely including Alice and her sisters.  **4. Calculating Cousins:** - **From Mother's Side:** **6 cousins**. - **From Father's Side:** **5 cousins** (including the paternal uncle's son).    **Total Cousins:** **6 (mother's side) + 5 (father's side) = 11 cousins**.  ### Answer: 11",
