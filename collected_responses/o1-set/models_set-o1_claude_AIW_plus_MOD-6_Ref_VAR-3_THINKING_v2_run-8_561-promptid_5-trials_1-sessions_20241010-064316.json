        "model_response":"Let's think through this problem step by step:  1. Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother. This means that Alice's sister has 1 sister (Alice) and 1 brother.  2. Alice's mother has 2 brothers. These brothers are Alice's sister's uncles. The children of these uncles would be Alice's sister's cousins.  3. Alice's mother also has 1 sister who does not have children. This sister has 7 nephews and nieces in total. These nephews and nieces are Alice's sister's cousins.  4. Alice's father has 2 sisters. These sisters are Alice's sister's aunts. The children of these aunts would be Alice's sister's cousins.  5. Alice's father also has a brother who has 5 nephews and nieces in total, and who also has 1 son. The 5 nephews and nieces are Alice's sister's cousins. The 1 son is also Alice's sister's cousin.  Now, let's count the total number of cousins:  - From Alice's mother's side:   - The number of cousins from Alice's mother's brothers is unknown.   - The number of cousins from Alice's mother's sister is 7.  - From Alice's father's side:   - The number of cousins from Alice's father's sisters is unknown.   - The number of cousins from Alice's father's brother is 5 + 1 = 6.  The total number of cousins = Unknown (from mother's brothers) + 7 (from mother's sister) + Unknown (from father's sisters) + 6 (from father's brother)  After double-checking the steps, I can confirm that the information provided is insufficient to determine the exact number of cousins Alice's sister has.

        "model_response":"Let's think through this step-by-step:  1. First, let's identify Alice's siblings:    - Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother    - This means Alice's parents have 4 children in total  2. Now, let's look at Alice's mother's side:    - Her mother has 2 brothers    - Her mother has 1 sister with no children    - The sister has 7 nephews and nieces in total  3. Looking at Alice's father's side:    - Her father has 2 sisters    - Her father has 1 brother    - This brother has 5 nephews and nieces in total    - This brother also has 1 son  4. To find Alice's sister's cousins, we need to count the children of Alice's aunts and uncles:    - From mother's side: 2 uncles, but we don't know how many children they have    - From father's side: 2 aunts (children unknown) and 1 uncle with 1 son  5. We can deduce the number of cousins from the information about nephews and nieces:    - Alice's mother's sister has 7 nephews and nieces    - We know 4 of these are Alice and her siblings    - So, the remaining 3 must be cousins from the mother's side  6. On the father's side:    - Alice's father's brother has 5 nephews and nieces    - Again, 4 of these are Alice and her siblings    - The remaining 1 is his own son, which we were told about  7. Adding up the cousins:    - 3 from mother's side    - 1 from father's side  8. Therefore, Alice's sister has 4 cousins in total  ### Answer: 4",

Alice's mother's sister (aunt) has 7 nephews and nieces in total:    - We know Alice and her 3 siblings account for 4 of these    - This means Alice's mother's brothers (uncles) must have 3 children in total (7 - 4 = 3)  5. Alice's father's brother (uncle) has 5 nephews and nieces in total:    - We know Alice and her 3 siblings account for 4 of these    - This uncle has 1 son, which is the 5th nephew\/niece  6.

Alice's mother has:    - 2 brothers    - 1 sister (who has no children)  3. Alice's father has:    - 2 sisters    - 1 brother (who has 1 son)  4. We need to count the children of Alice's aunts and uncles, excluding Alice and her siblings:     From mother's side:    - Mother's 2 brothers: We don't know how many children they have.    - Mother's sister: Has no children.     From father's side:    - Father's 2 sisters: We don't know how many children they have.    - Father's brother: Has 1 son.  5. We're told that Alice's mother's sister (who has no children) has 7 nephews and nieces in total.    These 7 must include Alice and her 3 siblings (4 total), plus the children of the mother's 2 brothers.    So, the mother's 2 brothers must have 3 children in total (7 - 4 = 3).  6. We're also told that Alice's father's brother (who has 1 son) has 5 nephews and nieces in total.    These 5 must be Alice and her 3 siblings (4 total), plus 1 more.    This extra 1 must be from the father's 2 sisters, so the father's 2 sisters have 1 child in total.  7. Now we can count Alice's cousins:    - From mother's side: 3 (from mother's 2 brothers)    - From father's side: 1 (from father's 2 sisters) + 1 (from father's brother) = 2  8.

Now, let's count Alice's cousins:    - From mother's side:      * Her 2 uncles might have children, but we don't have information about them.      * Her aunt has no children.    - From father's side:      * Her 2 aunts might have children, but we don't have specific information.      * Her uncle has 1 son, which is a definite cousin.  5. Additional information:    - Alice's mother's sister (aunt) has 7 nephews and nieces in total.    - Alice's father's brother (uncle) has 5 nephews and nieces in total.  6. Deducing from this:    - The 7 nephews and nieces of Alice's aunt include Alice, her 3 siblings, and 3 other cousins (likely from her mother's brothers).    - The 5 nephews and nieces of Alice's uncle include Alice and her 3 siblings, plus 1 more (which is his own son).  7. Therefore, we can conclude:    - Alice has 3 cousins from her mother's side (the other nephews\/nieces of her aunt, excluding Alice and her siblings)    - Alice has 1 cousin from her father's side (her uncle's son)  8. Total cousins: 3 + 1 = 4  9. The question asks about Alice's sister's cousins. Since Alice and her sister are siblings, they have the same cousins.
