Alice's mother has 2 brothers. The children of these brothers would be Alice's cousins.  3. Alice's mother also has 1 sister who does not have children. Since this sister doesn't have children, she doesn't contribute to the number of Alice's cousins.  4. The sister of Alice's mother has 2 nephews and 4 nieces.
