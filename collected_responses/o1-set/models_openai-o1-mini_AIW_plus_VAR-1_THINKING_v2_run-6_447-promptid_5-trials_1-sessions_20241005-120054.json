        "model_response":"Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the number of cousins Alice's sister has.  **1. Maternal Side:** - **Alice's Mother:**   - Has **1 sister (maternal aunt)** who **does not have children**.   - Has **2 brothers (maternal uncles)**. - **Maternal Aunts and Uncles' Children:**   - The **2 maternal uncles** have a total of **6 nephews and nieces**. These are Alice and her 2 sisters, plus 3 additional cousins from the uncles' children.  **2. Paternal Side:** - **Alice's Father:**   - Has **1 brother (paternal uncle)** who has **2 daughters**.   - The paternal uncle has **5 nephews and nieces** in total. Since Alice and her 2 sisters are already 3, this suggests there are **2 more cousins** from another sibling (likely a sister of the father).    **3. Total Cousins:** - **Maternal Cousins:** 6 - **Paternal Cousins:** 4 (2 from the uncle's daughters and 2 from another sibling's children)  **Adding them together:** 6 (maternal) + 4 (paternal) = **10 cousins**.  ### Answer: 10",

        "model_response":"Let's break down the relationships step by step to determine how many cousins Alice's sister has.  **1. Alice's Immediate Family:** - Alice has 2 sisters, making a total of 3 sisters in the family.  **2. Mother's Side:** - **Aunt (Mother's Sister):**   - Does not have children.   - Has 6 nephews and nieces.   - Has 2 brothers.    Since the aunt doesn't have children, her 6 nephews and nieces must be the children of her 2 brothers. These nephews and nieces are Alice's cousins from her mother's side.  **3. Father's Side:** - **Uncle (Father's Brother):**   - Has 5 nephews and nieces in total.   - Has 2 daughters.  The uncle's nephews and nieces are Alice and her sisters (total of 3). Since he has 5 nephews and nieces, this implies that Alice's father has 5 children in total (Alice, her 2 sisters, and possibly 2 brothers). However, for the purpose of counting cousins, we're focused on Alice's sisters.  **4. Calculating Cousins:** - **From Mother's Side:** 6 cousins (children of the mother's brothers). - **From Father's Side:** The uncle's nephews and nieces are Alice and her sisters, so there are no additional cousins from the father's side beyond Alice's immediate siblings.  **Total Cousins for Alice's Sister:** - 6 cousins from the mother's side.  ### Answer: 6",
