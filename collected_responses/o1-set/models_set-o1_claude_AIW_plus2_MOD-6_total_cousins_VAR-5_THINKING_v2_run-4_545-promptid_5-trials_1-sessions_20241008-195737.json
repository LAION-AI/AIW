Step 1: Determine the number of cousins from Alice's mother's side. - Alice's mother has 2 brothers, so their children will be Alice's cousins. - The total number of nephews and nieces for Alice's mother's sister is 6 (2 nephews + 4 nieces). - Since Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother, the number of cousins from Alice's mother's side is 6 - 3 = 3.  Step 2: Determine the number of cousins from Alice's father's side. - Alice's father has 2 sisters, so their children will be Alice's cousins. - Alice's father's brother has 1 nephew and 4 nieces, and 1 son. - The nephew mentioned is likely Alice's brother, so we should not count him as a cousin. - The number of cousins from Alice's father's side is 4 (the nieces).  Step 3: Calculate the total number of cousins Alice's sister has. - Alice's sister has the same number of cousins as Alice. - The total number of cousins is the sum of cousins from both sides of the family. - Total number of cousins = Cousins from mother's side + Cousins from father's side - Total number of cousins = 3 + 4 = 7  Double-checking the solution: - The given information is consistent, and the steps followed are logical. - The total number of cousins (7) matches the sum of cousins from both sides of the family.  ### Answer: Alice's sister has 7 cousins.",

Alice's mother's side:    * Alice's mother has 2 brothers.    * Alice's mother also has 1 sister who does not have children.    * Alice's mother's sister has 2 nephews and 4 nieces in total.      - These nephews and nieces are Alice and her siblings.  3. Alice's father's side:    * Alice's father has 2 sisters.    * Alice's father also has a brother who has 1 son.    * Alice's father's brother has 1 nephew and 4 nieces in total.      - The nephew is Alice's father's brother's son.      - The 4 nieces are Alice and her sisters.  4. Counting Alice's cousins:    * From Alice's mother's side:      - Alice's mother's brothers do not have any children mentioned.      - Alice's mother's sister does not have children.      - No cousins from Alice's mother's side.    * From Alice's father's side:      - Alice's father's brother has 1 son, who is Alice and her siblings' cousin.      - Alice's father's sisters do not have any children mentioned.      - Only 1 cousin from Alice's father's side.  5. Alice's sister's cousins:    * Alice and her sister have the same cousins.    * Therefore, Alice's sister has 1 cousin (from their father's side).  Double-checking the solution: * The given information does not mention any children of Alice's mother's brothers or Alice's father's sisters. * Alice's mother's sister and Alice's father's brother's children are accounted for, and they align with the total number of nephews and nieces mentioned. * The solution correctly identifies the only cousin from Alice's father's brother's son.  ### Answer: Alice's sister has 1 cousin.",

        "model_response":"Let's approach this problem step by step:  1. Alice's siblings:    - Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother.  2. Alice's mother's side:    - Alice's mother has 2 brothers.    - She also has 1 sister who does not have children.    - The sister has 2 nephews and 4 nieces in total.    - Since Alice's mother's sister does not have children, the nephews and nieces are from Alice's mother's brothers.    - Therefore, Alice has 6 cousins (2 male, 4 female) from her mother's side.  3. Alice's father's side:    - Alice's father has 2 sisters.    - He also has a brother who has 1 nephew and 4 nieces in total.    - Alice's father's brother also has 1 son.    - The nephew and nieces mentioned are Alice's father's brother's grandchildren, not his children.    - Alice's cousins from her father's side are the children of his sisters and brother.    - We don't know the exact number of cousins from Alice's father's side, but we know she has at least 1 male cousin (her father's brother's son).  4. Total cousins for Alice:    - Alice has 6 cousins from her mother's side.    - The number of cousins from her father's side is unknown, but there is at least 1.    - Therefore, Alice has at least 7 cousins in total.  5.

These are likely Alice, her 2 sisters, and her 1 brother. - Alice's father's brother has 1 nephew and 4 nieces. These are also likely Alice, her 2 sisters, and her 1 brother.
