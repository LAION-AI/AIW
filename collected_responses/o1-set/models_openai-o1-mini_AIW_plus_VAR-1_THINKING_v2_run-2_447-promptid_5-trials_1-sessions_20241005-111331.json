        "model_response":"To determine how many cousins Alice's sister has, let's break down the information step by step:  1. **Mother's Side:**    - **Mother's Siblings:** Alice's mother has 1 sister (Aunt) and 2 brothers.    - **Aunt's Children:** The Aunt does not have any children.    - **Uncles' Children:** The 2 brothers have a total of 6 nephews and nieces.    - **Cousins from Mother's Side:** All 6 nephews and nieces are Alice's cousins.  2. **Father's Side:**    - **Father's Sibling:** Alice's father has 1 brother (Uncle).    - **Uncle's Children:** The Uncle has 2 daughters.    - **Uncle's Nephews and Nieces:** The Uncle has 5 nephews and nieces in total. These include Alice and her 2 sisters, accounting for 3 of the 5. Therefore, there are 2 more nephews or nieces from the Father's side.  3. **Total Cousins:**    - **From Mother's Side:** 6 cousins.    - **From Father's Side:** 2 additional cousins (since Alice and her sisters are already accounted for).    - **Total Cousins:** 6 (mother's side) + 2 (father's side) = **8 cousins**.  ### Answer: 8",
