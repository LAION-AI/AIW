        "model_response":"To determine how many cousins Alice's sister has, we first need to figure out the relationships and family tree structure step-by-step.  **Step 1: Immediate Family (Alice's siblings and herself)** - Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother. - In total, there are 4 children in Alice's immediate family (Alice + 2 sisters + 1 brother).  **Step 2: Mother's Side** - Alice's mother has 2 brothers. - Alice's mother's sister has 6 nephews and nieces. Since the mother's sister has no children, all 6 nephews and nieces must be the children of the 2 brothers. - Therefore, each of Alice's mother's brothers has 3 children on average to make up these 6 (it may not always be even, but for calculation purposes, we split them equally).  **Step 3: Father's Side** - Alice's father has 2 sisters. - Alice's father also has a brother who has 5 nephews and nieces total and 1 son. - Since Alice's father\u2019s brother has 5 nephews and nieces, and Alice plus her 3 siblings account for 4 of those, this uncle's son must be the 5th child. - Therefore, Alice's father\u2019s brother has 1 child (his son).  **Summarizing the cousin count:** - From Alice's mother's side: 6 cousins (children of Alice's mother's two brothers). - From Alice's father's side: 1 cousin (child of Alice's father's brother).  Finally, adding these up:  6 (mother's side) + 1 (father's side) = 7 cousins.  Considering the problem is to find out how many cousins Alice's sister has:  ### Answer: 7",

Combining both sides:  - **Maternal side:**   - 2 cousins from Alice's mother's brothers.  - **Paternal side:**   - 1 cousin from Alice's father's brother.

This means Alice has **2 uncles** from her mother's side.    - Alice's mother also has **1 sister** who has **no children**. Therefore, this sister contributes **0 cousins**.     Now we need to determine how many children (nephews and nieces) Alice's uncles have:    - Alice's mother's two brothers have a total of **6 nephews and nieces** (counting Alice and her siblings). Since Alice and her siblings account for 4 of those, there are **2 children (cousins)** from Alice\u2019s mother\u2019s brothers.  3. **Alice's Father's Family:**    - Alice's father has **2 sisters**. Similar to her mother's side, we need to count how many cousins Alice has from her father's side through his siblings.    - Alice's father also has **1 brother**, who has **5 nephews and nieces** (including Alice and her siblings). Since Alice and her siblings count for 4 of those, this uncle has **1 child (cousin)**.

This means that Alice, along with her siblings, counts as a family of 4 children (3 siblings total).     2. **Alice's Mother's Family**:    - Alice's mother has **2 brothers**, which indicates that Alice has **2 maternal uncles**.    - Alice's mother has **1 sister** (because it mentions she has to have siblings other than the brothers). This sister does not have children. Hence, this sister has **0 cousins for Alice**.  3. **Alice's Maternal Uncles' Families**:    - Alice's mother's **2 brothers** can potentially have children, but we do not have specific information in this problem about whether they do or do not have children. Therefore, we cannot count any additional cousins from this side of the family.  4. **Alice's Father's Family**:    - Alice's father has **2 sisters**, which would mean Alice can potentially have cousins from both of her father's sisters.    - Her father also has **1 brother** who has **5 nephews and nieces in total**. This brother must mean he has children, presumably Alice's cousins.   5. **Alice's Father's Brother's Children**:    - Since Alice and her siblings are some of the nephews and nieces of Alice's father\u2019s brother, that implies there are **5 total children** in the count. However, we currently know that Alice's father has **1 brother**. This brother has **1 son**, hence he also must have **4 daughters** (since Alice and her siblings count amongst the cousins concerning their father's brother's children, indicating there are potentially at least 3 to 4 more children).  6. **Alice's Total Cousins**:    - From Alice's father's side, we counted:      - **Cousins from Alice's father\u2019s brother**: 1 son + 4 daughters = = **5 cousins**.      - Cousins from Alice's father's sisters cannot be determined as we do not have information about children for her father's sisters.     So now we consolidate to find out how many cousins Alice's sisters have: - Alice's **sister** will share the same cousins as Alice since they are siblings. - Overall, Alice has a total of **5 cousins** from her father's brother.  Finally: - Since both Alice and her sisters count the same cousins in the family tree, they all will have the same number.  ### Answer: 5",

The problem doesn't provide any specific count of children from her maternal uncles, so we cannot directly count these cousins.  5. **Identify Alice\u2019s father's siblings:**    - Alice's father has 2 sisters and 1 brother.  6. **Identify Alice's paternal aunt's children:**    - Alice\u2019s father\u2019s sisters may have children, but we don\u2019t have information on how many.  7. **Identify Alice's paternal uncle's children:**    - Alice\u2019s father has 1 brother who has 5 nephews and nieces in total and 1 son. The 5 nephews and nieces could include Alice and her siblings.  8. **Breakdown of Alice's cousins from her paternal uncle:**    - If we take into account that Alice and her siblings fall into the category of the 5 nephews and nieces, this leaves 4 other children (cousins) from the uncle, one of whom is the uncle's son.    - Therefore, the paternal uncle must have at least 4 children since Alice and her siblings counted toward the total.  9. **Total count of cousins for Alice (and her siblings):**    - Alice has at least 4 cousins from her paternal uncle's side, and we still need to find out the cousins from her father's sisters (the aunts) and her mother's brothers (the uncles).  10. **Calculating the cousins from maternal side (more unspecified as we don't have exact numbers):**    - Alice's maternal cousins depend on the children her maternal uncles have, which are not specified.  In conclusion, given the known data: - Alice has 4 known cousins from her paternal uncle, - The number of cousins from her maternal uncles is unspecified.  Thus, **Alice's sister**, having the same siblings and family structure, also has the same 4 known cousins from the paternal uncle.

This means Alice has 2 uncles on her mother's side.    - Alice's mother also has 1 sister (as mentioned in the problem) who does not have children. Hence, this sister has no children to add to Alice's cousins.    - Alice's mother's 2 brothers may have children, but we aren't given any specific information about how many children those uncles have. They could have children, but without information provided, we can't count them.  3. **Alice's Father's Family**:    - Alice's father has 2 sisters. Therefore, Alice has 2 aunts on her father's side.    - Alice's father also has a brother who has a total of 5 nephews and nieces. Since we already know Alice and her siblings (4 in total) are counted among those nieces and nephews, the brother must have 1 additional child (the son mentioned).    - So Alice's father's brother has 1 son, making him Alice\u2019s cousin.  4. **Total Cousins Calculation**:    - Alice's cousins from her mother's side are unknown because the information about her mother's brothers' children is missing.    - Alice's cousins from her father's side consist of:      - 2 aunts (uncles' children are also her cousins) + 1 male cousin from her father's brother (as explained above).  5. **Conclusion on Alice's Sister\u2019s Cousins**:    - From her father's side, Alice has 1 male cousin, but we don\u2019t know anything about Alice\u2019s mother\u2019s brothers\u2019 children.    - Thus, at a minimum, Alice's sister has 1 cousin from the father's side. However, for accurate counting, we\u2019d need to know about any children of the uncles on Alice's mother side.    As a result, without additional information on Alice's mother's 2 brothers and their children, we can say that Alice's sister has at least 1 cousin, and potentially more.
