        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we need to piece together Alice's extended family tree carefully.  **On the maternal side:**  - **Alice's mother** has:   - **1 childless sister** (Alice's aunt) who **has 6 nephews and nieces**.   - **2 brothers** (Alice's uncles).  The childless aunt's nephews and nieces are the children of her siblings (Alice's mother and her two brothers). Since Alice's mother has **4 daughters** (Alice and her 3 sisters), and the aunt has a total of 6 nephews and nieces, the two brothers must have **2 children** between them (because \\(6 - 4 = 2\\)). So, Alice has **2 maternal cousins**.  **On the paternal side:**  - **Alice's father** has:   - **1 brother** (Alice's uncle) who **has 1 son**.   - This uncle also **has 5 nephews and nieces**.  Since the uncle has 5 nephews and nieces, and Alice and her 3 sisters account for **4 of them**, there must be **another sibling** of Alice's father who has **1 child** (because \\(5 - 4 = 1\\)). Therefore, Alice has **2 paternal cousins** (1 son of her uncle and 1 child of the other sibling).  **Adding them up:**  - **Maternal cousins**: 2 - **Paternal cousins**: 2 - **Total cousins**: \\(2 + 2 = 4\\)  Therefore, **Alice's sister has 4 cousins**.  ### Answer: 4",

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we'll need to carefully map out Alice's extended family and count her cousins, who are the children of her parents' siblings.  **Alice's Immediate Family:** - Alice has 3 sisters. So, her parents have 4 children in total.  **On Alice's Mother's Side:** - Alice's mother has:   - 1 sister who **does not have children**.   - 2 brothers.  - The childless sister has **6 nephews and nieces**. Since she doesn't have children, these are her siblings' children.    - Alice's mother has 4 children (Alice and her sisters), so her brothers collectively have:   - Total nephews and nieces = 6.   - Nephews and nieces from Alice's mother = 4 (Alice and her sisters).   - Therefore, the two brothers have **2 children** between them (6 - 4 = 2).  - **Cousins on Mother's Side:** 2 (children of the two brothers).  **On Alice's Father's Side:** - Alice's father has a brother who:   - Has **1 son**.   - Has **5 nephews and nieces** in total.  - The brother's nephews and nieces are the children of his siblings. Since Alice's father has 4 children (Alice and her sisters), and the brother counts 5 nephews and nieces, there must be another sibling with at least **1 child**.  - Therefore, Alice's father has:   - The brother (who has 1 son).   - Another sibling (possibly a sister) who has **1 child**.  - **Cousins on Father's Side:** 2 (the son of the brother and the child of the other sibling).  **Total Cousins:** - Maternal cousins: 2. - Paternal cousins: 2. - **Total cousins Alice's sister has:** 2 + 2 = **4**.

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of cousins that Alice's sister has, which equals the total number of children of Alice's parents' siblings.  **Step-by-step solution:**  1. **Identify Alice's siblings:**    - Alice has 3 sisters, so including herself, that's 4 daughters.    - From information about her father's brother (who has 5 nephews and nieces), we deduce that Alice's father has 5 children in total because his only sibling's nephews and nieces are Alice and her siblings.    - Therefore, Alice has one more sibling, likely a brother.    - Total siblings in Alice's family: 5 (Alice, 3 sisters, and 1 brother).  2. **Determine maternal cousins (children of Alice's mother's siblings):**    - Alice's mother has:      - 1 sister (childless aunt).      - 2 brothers.    - The childless aunt has 6 nephews and nieces. Since Alice's mother has 5 children, the remaining 1 nephew\/niece must come from the uncles.    - Therefore, the two maternal uncles have 1 child between them.    - Maternal cousins: 1.  3. **Determine paternal cousins (children of Alice's father's siblings):**    - Alice's father has one brother who has 1 son.    - Paternal cousins: 1.  4. **Calculate total cousins:**    - Total cousins = Maternal cousins + Paternal cousins    - Total cousins = 1 + 1 = 2.  **Final Answer:**  ### Answer: 2",
