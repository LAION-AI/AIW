        "model_response":"To determine the number of cousins Alice's sister has, let's break down the information given and solve the problem step by step.  Given: - Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother. - Alice's mother has 2 brothers. - Alice's mother has 1 sister who does not have children and who has 3 nephews and 4 nieces. - Alice's father has 2 sisters. - Alice's father has a brother who has 1 nephew, 4 nieces, and 1 son.  Step 1: Determine the number of cousins from Alice's mother's side. - Alice's mother's brothers do not have any information about their children, so we cannot determine the number of cousins from them. - Alice's mother's sister does not have children, so she does not contribute to the number of cousins.  Step 2: Determine the number of cousins from Alice's father's side. - Alice's father's sisters do not have any information about their children, so we cannot determine the number of cousins from them. - Alice's father's brother has 1 son, who is a cousin to Alice and her siblings.  Step 3: Calculate the total number of cousins for Alice's sister. - From the given information, we can only confirm 1 cousin from Alice's father's brother. - Alice's sister has the same number of cousins as Alice.  Therefore, based on the given information, Alice's sister has at least 1 cousin.  Double-checking the solution: - The information about Alice's mother's sister's nephews and nieces does not contribute to the number of Alice's cousins because her sister does not have children. - The information about Alice's father's brother's nephews and nieces does not contribute to the number of Alice's cousins because those nephews and nieces are not related to Alice's father.  ### Answer: Based on the given information, Alice's sister has at least 1 cousin.",
