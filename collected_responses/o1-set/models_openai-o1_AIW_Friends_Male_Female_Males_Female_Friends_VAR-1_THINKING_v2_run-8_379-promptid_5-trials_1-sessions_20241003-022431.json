        "model_response":"The key to solving this problem is carefully interpreting the given information.  1. **Understanding the Group:**    - **Alice** has **3 male friends** and **6 female friends**. That makes a total of **9 friends**.    - Including Alice herself, the group contains **10 people**.    - The statement \"They all are friends with each other\" implies that **everyone in this group is friends with everyone else**. This forms a **clique** where every person is connected to every other person.  2. **Identifying the Male Friend:**    - We are to consider **one male friend** of Alice.  3. **Determining the Female Friends of the Male Friend:**    - Since **everyone is friends with everyone else**, this male friend is friends with:      - **Alice** (who is female).      - The **6 female friends** of Alice.    - Therefore, the male friend has:      - **Total female friends = Alice + 6 female friends = 7 female friends**.  ### Answer: 7",
