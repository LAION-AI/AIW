        "model_response":"To find out how many cousins Alice's sister has, let's break down the family relationships step by step.  1. **Alice's Immediate Family**:    - Alice has **3 sisters**. Since Alice herself is also a sibling, that makes **4 children** in Alice's family.    - However, from later information, we find that Alice's father has **5 children**. This suggests that Alice has a **brother** as well. So Alice's siblings are **3 sisters and 1 brother**, totaling **5 children**.  2. **Maternal Side**:    - Alice's mother has **1 sister** (who is childless) and **2 brothers**.    - The childless aunt has **6 nephews and nieces**. These nephews and nieces are the children of her siblings (Alice's mother and the two uncles).    - We know Alice's mother has **5 children** (from point 1).    - Therefore, the two uncles must have **1 child each** because the total number of nephews and nieces is **6** (5 from Alice's mother and 1 from one of the uncles).    - So, on the maternal side, Alice has **2 cousins**.  3. **Paternal Side**:    - Alice's father has **1 brother** who has **1 son**.    - This uncle has **5 nephews and nieces**. These are the children of Alice's father.    - Since the uncle's own son is not his nephew, the **5 nephews and nieces** must be Alice and her **4 siblings**.    - So, on the paternal side, Alice has **1 cousin** (the uncle's son).  4. **Total Cousins**:    - Maternal cousins: **2**    - Paternal cousins: **1**    - **Total cousins**: **2 + 1 = 3**  ### Answer: 3",

Since she has no children of her own, these must be the children of her siblings (Alice's mother and the two brothers). - Alice's mother has **4 children** (Alice and her sisters). - This means the two brothers must have a combined **2 children** (because 6 nephews and nieces minus the 4 from Alice's mother leaves 2 from the brothers). - **Maternal Cousins:** Alice has **2 cousins** from her mother's side.  **Paternal Side:** - Alice's father has:   - **1 brother** (Alice's paternal uncle) who has **1 son**.   - The uncle has **5 nephews and nieces**. These are the children of his siblings. - Alice and her sisters account for **4** of these nephews and nieces. - This implies there must be **another sibling** (Alice's aunt or uncle) who has at least **1 child** (since 5 nephews and nieces minus the 4 from Alice's father leaves at least 1 from another sibling). - **Paternal Cousins:** Alice has **1 cousin** (her uncle's son) plus at least **1 cousin** from the other sibling, totaling **2 cousins** from her father's side.  **Total Cousins:** - **2 maternal cousins** + **2 paternal cousins** = **4 cousins**.  ### Answer: 4",
