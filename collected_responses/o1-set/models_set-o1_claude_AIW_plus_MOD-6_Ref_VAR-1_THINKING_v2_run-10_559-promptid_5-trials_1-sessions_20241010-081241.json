        "model_response":"Let's think through this step-by-step:  1. Alice has 1 sister and 1 brother. This means Alice's parents have 3 children in total.  2. Alice's mother has:    - 2 brothers    - 1 sister (who has no children)  3. Alice's father has:    - 2 sisters    - 1 brother (who has 2 sons)  4. We need to count the children of Alice's aunts and uncles, excluding Alice and her siblings:     From mother's side:    - Mother's 2 brothers: We don't know how many children they have.    - Mother's sister: Has no children.     From father's side:    - Father's 2 sisters: We don't know how many children they have.    - Father's brother: Has 2 sons.  5. We're told that the mother's sister (who has no children) has 6 nephews and nieces in total. This includes:    - Alice and her 2 siblings (3)    - Children of mother's 2 brothers (unknown number, let's call it x)    So: 3 + x = 6    x = 3  6. We're also told that the father's brother (who has 2 sons) has 5 nephews and nieces in total. This includes:    - Alice and her 2 siblings (3)    - Children of father's 2 sisters (unknown number, let's call it y)    So: 3 + y = 5    y = 2  7. Now we can count Alice's sister's cousins:    - From mother's side: 3 (children of mother's 2 brothers)    - From father's side: 2 (children of father's 2 sisters) + 2 (sons of father's brother) = 4  8. Total number of cousins: 3 + 4 = 7  Therefore, Alice's sister has 7 cousins.  ### Answer: 7",

        "model_response":"Let's approach this step-by-step:  1. First, let's identify Alice's immediate family:    - Alice has 1 sister and 1 brother    - So, Alice's parents have 3 children in total  2. Now, let's look at Alice's mother's side:    - Alice's mother has 2 brothers    - Alice's mother has 1 sister who doesn't have children    - The sister has 6 nephews and nieces in total  3. On Alice's father's side:    - Alice's father has 2 sisters    - Alice's father has 1 brother    - This brother has 5 nephews and nieces in total    - This brother also has 2 sons  4. To find Alice's sister's cousins, we need to count the children of Alice's aunts and uncles:     From mother's side:    - 2 uncles: We don't know how many children they have     From father's side:    - 2 aunts: We don't know how many children they have    - 1 uncle: We know he has 2 sons  5. The key information is that Alice's father's brother has 5 nephews and nieces in total.     This includes Alice and her 2 siblings (3), plus any children his sisters might have.  6. Since we know the total (5) and we know 3 of these are Alice and her siblings,     the remaining 2 must be children of Alice's father's sisters.  7. So, the cousins of Alice's sister are:    - 2 from her father's sisters    - 2 from her father's brother  Therefore, Alice's sister has 4 cousins in total.  ### Answer: 4",

Now, let's count the children of these aunts and uncles:    - Mother's sister: No children    - Mother's 2 brothers: We don't know if they have children    - Father's 2 sisters: We don't know if they have children    - Father's brother: 2 sons  3. We're told that Alice's mother's sister has 6 nephews and nieces in total. These would be:    - Alice    - Alice's sister    - Alice's brother    - 2 sons of Alice's father's brother    - 1 more child we haven't accounted for yet  4. We're also told that Alice's father's brother has 5 nephews and nieces in total. These would be:    - Alice    - Alice's sister    - Alice's brother    - 2 more children we haven't accounted for yet  5. From points 3 and 4, we can deduce that there must be 2 more cousins (the unaccounted children from both sides).  6. So, the total number of cousins would be:    - 2 sons of Alice's father's brother    - 2 additional cousins deduced from the information given  Therefore, Alice's sister has 4 cousins in total.  ### Answer: 4",

We can use the information about nephews and nieces to figure out the missing information:    - On mother's side: The aunt with no children has 6 nephews and nieces      * These 6 must be Alice, her 2 siblings, and 3 cousins from her mother's 2 brothers    - On father's side: The uncle with 2 sons has 5 nephews and nieces      * These 5 must be Alice and her 2 siblings, plus 2 cousins from her father's 2 sisters  6.

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we'll need to determine how many cousins Alice's sister has by calculating the total number of children of her parents' siblings (excluding her own immediate family).  **Alice's Immediate Family:** - Alice has 1 sister and 1 brother. - So, Alice's mother and father have 3 children in total: Alice, her sister, and her brother.  **Maternal Side (Mother's Siblings):** - Alice's mother has 2 brothers and 1 sister. - The sister has **no children** but has **6 nephews and nieces**. These nephews and nieces are the children of Alice's mother and her two brothers. - Alice's mother has 3 children (Alice and her siblings). - Let the total number of children of the two maternal uncles be **X**. - So, \\( 3 (Alice's mother's children) + X (uncles' children) = 6 (total nephews and nieces) \\). - Solving for \\( X \\): \\( X = 6 - 3 = 3 \\). - **Maternal Cousins:** The children of the two maternal uncles, totaling **3**.  **Paternal Side (Father's Siblings):** - Alice's father has 2 sisters and 1 brother. - The brother has **2 sons** and has **5 nephews and nieces**. - The nephews and nieces of the brother are the children of Alice's father and his two sisters. - Alice's father has 3 children (Alice and her siblings). - Let the total number of children of the two paternal aunts be **Y**. - So, \\( 3 (Alice's father's children) + Y (aunts' children) = 5 (total nephews and nieces) \\). - Solving for \\( Y \\): \\( Y = 5 - 3 = 2 \\). - **Paternal Cousins:**   - Children of the paternal aunts: **2**.   - Children of the paternal uncle (father's brother): **2** sons.   - Total paternal cousins: \\( 2 + 2 = 4 \\).  **Total Cousins:** - Maternal cousins: **3**. - Paternal cousins: **4**. - Total cousins: \\( 3 + 4 = 7 \\).  **Answer: 7**",

This aunt has 6 nephews and nieces in total. These nephews and nieces are the children of Alice's mother's brothers (from step 2).
