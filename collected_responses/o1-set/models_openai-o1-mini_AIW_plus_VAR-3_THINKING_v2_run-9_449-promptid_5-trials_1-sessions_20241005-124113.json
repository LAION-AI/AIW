        "model_response":"Let's break down the problem step by step to determine how many cousins Alice's sister has.  1. **Alice and Her Sisters:**    - Alice has 3 sisters, making a total of 4 sisters.  2. **Mother's Side:**    - **Mother's Siblings:**      - 1 sister (Aunt) who does not have children.      - 2 brothers.    - **Nephews and Nieces from Mother's Side:**      - The Aunt has 7 nephews and nieces. Since she doesn't have children, these must be the children of her 2 brothers.      - Therefore, the 2 brothers have a combined total of 7 children.  3. **Father's Side:**    - **Father's Sibling:**      - 1 brother (Uncle) who has 1 son.    - **Nephews and Nieces from Father's Side:**      - The Uncle has 5 nephews and nieces in total. These are the children of his siblings.      - Since Alice and her 3 sisters are the children of the father, they account for 4 nephews and nieces.      - However, the problem states there are 5 nephews and nieces, suggesting there might be another sibling or an error in the provided information. For consistency, we'll proceed with the given number of 5 nephews and nieces.  4. **Total Cousins:**    - **From Mother's Side:** 7 cousins.    - **From Father's Side:** 5 cousins.    - **Total Cousins:** 7 (mother's side) + 5 (father's side) = **12 cousins**.  ### Answer: 12",
