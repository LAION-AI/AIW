        "model_response":"To determine how many cousins Alice's sister has, let's break down the information step by step:  1. **Alice's Immediate Family:**    - **Siblings:** Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother, making a total of 4 children in the family (including Alice).     2. **Mother's Side:**    - **Uncles:** Alice's mother has 2 brothers. However, there's no information provided about whether they have children. Therefore, we assume they have no children unless stated otherwise.  3. **Father's Side:**    - **Aunts:** Alice's father has 2 sisters. Again, there's no information about whether they have children.    - **Uncle:** Alice's father also has a brother (paternal uncle) who has 1 son.  4. **Alice's Sister:**    - The sister who does not have children has 6 nephews and nieces, which come from Alice and her brother's children.    - Since Alice and her brother have a total of 6 children, these are the nieces and nephews referred to.  5. **Cousins:**    - The only explicitly mentioned cousin is the son of Alice's paternal uncle.  Since there is no information about additional cousins from the mother's brothers or the father's sisters, we conclude that Alice's sister has **1 cousin**.  ### Answer: 1",

The number of their children (Alice's cousins from the mother's side) isn't specified.  3. **Alice's Father's Siblings:**    - Father has 2 sisters (paternal aunts).    - Father has 1 brother, Uncle3.      - Uncle3 has 1 son.      - Uncle3 has 4 nephews and nieces in total, which are Alice and her 3 siblings.  4. **Additional Information:**    - One of Alice's sisters has no children but has 6 nephews and nieces, which come from Alice and her brother's children.

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's break down the information step by step and create a family tree to visualize the relationships.  **Alice's Immediate Family:** - Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother. So, Alice's parents have 4 children in total.  **Maternal Side (Alice's Mother's Family):** - Alice's mother has:   - 2 brothers (Maternal Uncles).   - 1 sister who does not have children but has 6 nephews and nieces in total.  Since the maternal aunt has no children, her 6 nephews and nieces must be the children of her siblings (Alice's mother and her 2 brothers). We already know that Alice's mother has 4 children (Alice and her siblings), so the 2 maternal uncles must have a combined total of **2 children** (6 total nephews and nieces - 4 from Alice's mother = 2 from the uncles).  **Paternal Side (Alice's Father's Family):** - Alice's father has:   - 2 sisters (Paternal Aunts) who do not have children (explained below).   - 1 brother (Paternal Uncle) who has:     - 1 son.     - 4 nephews and nieces in total.  The paternal uncle's nephews and nieces are the children of his siblings (Alice's father and the 2 paternal aunts). Since he has 4 nephews and nieces and Alice's father has 4 children, the 2 paternal aunts must have **0 children** (4 nephews and nieces - 4 from Alice's father = 0 from the aunts).  **Calculating Alice's Sister's Cousins:** - From the maternal side:   - **2 cousins** (children of the 2 maternal uncles). - From the paternal side:   - **1 cousin** (son of the paternal uncle).  **Total cousins Alice's sister has:** - **2 (maternal cousins) + 1 (paternal cousin) = 3 cousins**  ### Answer: 3",
