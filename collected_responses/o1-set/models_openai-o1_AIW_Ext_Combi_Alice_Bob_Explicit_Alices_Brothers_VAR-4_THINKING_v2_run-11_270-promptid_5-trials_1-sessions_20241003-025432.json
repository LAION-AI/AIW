        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we'll carefully analyze the information provided and deduce the family relationships step by step.  1. **Alice and Bob are sister and brother**, so they are siblings in the same family.  2. **Alice has 3 sisters**. Typically, when someone says they have a certain number of sisters, they are excluding themselves. Therefore, besides Alice, there are 3 other sisters. So, there are **4 sisters in total**.  3. **Bob has 1 brother**. Similarly, this count excludes himself. This means there is **1 brother besides Bob**, making a total of **2 brothers**.  4. Now, combining the counts, the family has **4 sisters** and **2 brothers**, totaling **6 children**.  5. **Alice's Brothers**: Since the brothers in the family are Bob and his brother, these are also Alice's brothers.  Therefore, **Alice has 2 brothers**.  ### Answer: 2",

Alice and Bob are sister and brother, meaning they are siblings. 2. **Alice has 3 sisters** (excluding herself). 3. **Bob has 1 brother** (excluding himself).  First, let's determine the total number of girls and boys in the family:  - **Number of girls:** Since Alice has 3 sisters and she herself is a girl, there are **4 girls** in total. - **Number of boys:** Since Bob has 1 brother and he himself is a boy, there are **2 boys** in total.  Next, let's calculate how many brothers Alice has:  - The brothers in the family are **Bob** and his brother. - Therefore, **Alice has 2 brothers**.  ### Answer: 2",
