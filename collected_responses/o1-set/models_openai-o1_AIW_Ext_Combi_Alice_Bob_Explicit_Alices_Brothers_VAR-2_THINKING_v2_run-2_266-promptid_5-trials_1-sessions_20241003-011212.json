        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we'll carefully consider the information given step by step:  1. **Alice and Bob are sister and brother**, meaning they are siblings in the same family.  2. **Alice has 2 sisters.** Typically, when someone says they have a certain number of sisters, it means *in addition to themselves*. Therefore, besides Alice, there are 2 other sisters:    - Alice    - Sister 1    - Sister 2  3. **Bob has 2 brothers.** Similarly, this means Bob has 2 brothers besides himself. So the brothers are:    - Bob    - Brother 1    - Brother 2  4. **Total siblings in the family:**    - **Sisters (Girls):** Alice, Sister 1, Sister 2 (3 sisters)    - **Brothers (Boys):** Bob, Brother 1, Brother 2 (3 brothers)  5. **Question:** How many brothers does Alice have?     Since all the siblings share the same parents:    - Alice's brothers are Bob, Brother 1, and Brother 2.    - Therefore, **Alice has 3 brothers**.  ### Answer: 3",
