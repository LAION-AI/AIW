        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's carefully analyze the information step by step:  1. **Alice and Bob are sister and brother.**    - This means Alice and Bob are siblings of opposite genders.  2. **Alice has 2 sisters.**    - Since people usually don't count themselves when stating the number of siblings, Alice has **2 sisters in addition to herself**.    - Therefore, there are **3 sisters in total**: Alice, Sister 1, and Sister 2.  3. **Bob has 2 brothers.**    - Similarly, Bob has **2 brothers besides himself**.    - Therefore, there are **3 brothers in total**: Bob, Brother 1, and Brother 2.  4. **Total number of siblings in the family:**    - **3 sisters (including Alice) + 3 brothers (including Bob) = 6 siblings**.  5. **Determine the number of brothers Alice has:**    - Alice's brothers are all the male siblings in the family.    - The brothers are: **Bob, Brother 1, and Brother 2**.    - Therefore, **Alice has 3 brothers**.  ### Answer: 3",

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given step by step.  1. Alice and Bob are siblings (sister and brother). 2. **Alice has 2 sisters.** This means there are 2 other girls besides Alice in the family. So, there are **3 sisters in total**. 3. **Bob has 2 brothers.** This means there are 2 other boys besides Bob in the family. So, there are **3 brothers in total**. 4. Therefore, the family has **6 children in total**: 3 sisters and 3 brothers.  Since Alice is one of the sisters, the **brothers in the family are Bob and his 2 brothers**. Therefore, **Alice has 3 brothers**.  ### Answer: 3",
