Since she has no children, these are the children of her siblings (Alice's mother and the 2 uncles). - The number of nephews and nieces comes from:   - **Alice and her 2 sisters**: **3 children**.   - **Children of the 2 uncles**: Let's denote the total number as **x**. - So, \\( 3 \\text{ (from Alice's mother)} + x \\text{ (from uncles)} = 6 \\), thus **x = 3**. - Therefore, **Alice has 3 maternal cousins** from her uncles.  **Paternal Side:** - **Alice's father** has a **brother** who:   - Has **2 daughters** (Alice's paternal cousins).   - Has **4 nephews and nieces** in total. - The **uncle's nephews and nieces** are the children of his siblings. - Since Alice's father is one sibling and the uncle is another, there must be at least one more sibling to account for all 4 nephews and nieces. - **Alice and her 2 sisters** account for **3 nephews\/nieces**. - Therefore, there must be **another sibling** who has **1 child**, making up the total of **4 nephews and nieces**. - So, **Alice has 1 more paternal cousin** from this other sibling.  **Total Cousins:** - **Maternal cousins**: **3** - **Paternal cousins**: **2 (from the uncle with 2 daughters) + 1 (from the other sibling) = 3** - **Total cousins**: \\( 3 \\text{ (maternal)} + 3 \\text{ (paternal)} = 6 \\)  **Answer: 6**",

These would be Alice and her siblings. Therefore, Alice's father must have **4 children** (Alice, her 2 sisters, and a brother).    - So, Alice's immediate family consists of **4 siblings**.  2. **Father's Side Cousins:**    - Alice's father has a brother (Alice's uncle) who has **2 daughters**. These are Alice's cousins from her father's side.    - **Total cousins from father's side: 2**  3. **Mother's Side Family:**    - Alice's mother has:      - **1 sister** who **does not have children**.      - **2 brothers**.    - The childless sister has **6 nephews and nieces**. These come from her siblings' children.    - Alice's mother has **4 children** (from step 1).    - Therefore, the **2 brothers together have 2 children** (since 6 nephews and nieces minus 4 from Alice's mother equals 2).    - These 2 children are Alice's cousins from her mother's side.    - **Total cousins from mother's side: 2**  4. **Total Cousins:**    - **Father's side cousins: 2**    - **Mother's side cousins: 2**    - **Total cousins Alice's sister has: 2 + 2 = 4**  ### Answer: 4",

        "model_response":"To determine the number of cousins Alice's sister has, we need to analyze the family relationships carefully.  First, let's understand Alice's immediate family.

The childless sister has **6 nephews and nieces**. These are the children of her siblings:  - **Alice's mother** has **3 daughters** (Alice and her 2 sisters). - **The 2 brothers** must have the remaining **3 children** (since 6 nephews and nieces - 3 from Alice's mother = 3 from the brothers).  So, on her mother's side, **Alice has 3 cousins** (children of her mother's brothers).  **Father's Side:**  - **Alice's father** has:   - **1 brother** who has **2 daughters**.   - Another **sibling (Sibling X)** (since the brother has **4 nephews and nieces**, and Alice's family accounts for only **3**).  The brother's **4 nephews and nieces** are: - **3 nieces** from Alice's father (Alice and her 2 sisters). - **1 nephew\/niece** from **Sibling X**.  So, on her father's side, **Alice has 2 cousins** (her uncle's daughters) and **1 cousin** (child of Sibling X).  **Total Cousins:**  - **Mother's side**: **3 cousins**. - **Father's side**: **3 cousins**. - **Total**: **6 cousins**.  ### Answer: 6",
