        "model_response":"Okay, let's think this through step by step:  1. Alice has 1 sister and 1 brother. This means that Alice's sister has 1 brother (Alice's brother).  2. Alice's mother has 2 brothers. The children of these brothers would be Alice's sister's cousins. However, we don't know how many children they have in total.  3. Alice's mother also has 1 sister who does not have children. This sister has 6 nephews and nieces in total. These nephews and nieces are the children of Alice's mother's brothers (mentioned in step 2). Therefore, Alice's sister has 6 cousins from her mother's side.  4. Alice's father has 2 sisters.

Alice's father also has a brother who has 5 nephews and nieces in total, and who also has 1 daughter. The 5 nephews and nieces are the children of Alice's father's sisters (mentioned in step 4). Therefore, Alice's sister has 5 cousins from her father's side.  6. The daughter of Alice's father's brother is also Alice's sister's cousin. So, we need to add 1 more cousin to the count from the father's side.  7. In total, Alice's sister has 6 cousins from her mother's side and 6 cousins (5 + 1) from her father's side.  Double-checking the solution: - Alice's sister has 6 cousins from her mother's side (the nephews and nieces of Alice's mother's sister). - Alice's sister has 6 cousins from her father's side (5 nephews and nieces of Alice's father's brother, plus his 1 daughter). - The total number of cousins is 6 + 6 = 12.  ### Answer: Alice's sister has 12 cousins in total.",
