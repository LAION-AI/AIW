Alice's mother has 2 brothers, but we don't know how many children they have. 3. Alice's mother also has 1 sister who doesn't have children but has 6 nephews and nieces. These 6 nephews and nieces are the children of Alice's mother's brothers. 4. Since Alice's mother has 4 children (Alice, her 2 sisters, and 1 brother), the remaining 2 nephews and nieces of Alice's mother's sister must be the children of Alice's mother's brothers. 5. Alice's father has 2 sisters, but we don't know how many children they have. 6. Alice's father also has a brother who has 1 son and a total of 5 nephews and nieces. The 1 son is not counted as a nephew, so the brother has 4 nephews and nieces from other siblings. 7. Alice and her siblings are counted among these 4 nephews and nieces of Alice's father's brother.  Now, let's count the cousins: - From Alice's mother's side: 2 cousins (children of Alice's mother's brothers) - From Alice's father's side: The number of children of Alice's father's sisters is unknown, so we can't count these cousins.  Therefore, we can only determine that Alice's sister has at least 2 cousins from her mother's side. The total number of cousins cannot be determined due to the lack of information about the children of Alice's father's sisters.  ### Answer: The exact number of cousins cannot be determined based on the given information.

On Alice's father's side:    - Her father has 2 sisters    - Her father has 1 brother    - This brother has 5 nephews and nieces in total    - This brother has 1 son  4.

The key information is:    - Alice's mother's sister has 6 nephews and nieces    - Alice's father's brother has 5 nephews and nieces  6. Since Alice and her siblings account for 4 of these nephews and nieces on both sides, we can deduce:    - Mother's side: 6 - 4 = 2 other cousins    - Father's side: 5 - 4 = 1 other cousin (which is the uncle's son we know about)  7.

Total number of cousins: 2 + 2 = 4  Double-checking: - We've accounted for all aunts and uncles mentioned - We've used the information about nephews and nieces to confirm our calculations - The numbers add up correctly  Therefore, Alice's sister has 4 cousins.  ### Answer: 4",

        "model_response":"Let's think through this step-by-step:  1. First, let's identify Alice's siblings:    - Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother    - So, Alice's parents have 4 children in total  2. Now, let's look at Alice's mother's side:    - Alice's mother has 2 brothers and 1 sister    - The sister doesn't have children    - We don't know if the brothers have children  3. On Alice's father's side:    - Alice's father has 2 sisters and 1 brother    - The brother has 1 son    - We don't know if the sisters have children  4. Important information:    - Alice's mother's sister has 6 nephews and nieces in total    - Alice's father's brother has 5 nephews and nieces in total  5. Let's analyze the nephews and nieces:    - Alice and her 3 siblings account for 4 of the 6 nephews and nieces mentioned for the mother's sister    - This means there must be 2 more cousins from the mother's brothers  6. On the father's side:    - We know Alice's father's brother has 1 son    - We also know he has 5 nephews and nieces in total    - 4 of these are Alice and her siblings    - So there must be 1 more cousin from the father's sisters  7. Adding up the cousins:    - 2 from mother's side    - 1 from father's side    - 1 son of father's brother    - Total: 4 cousins  Therefore, Alice's sister has 4 cousins.  ### Answer: 4",

Now, let's look at Alice's mother's side:    - Mother has 2 brothers    - Mother has 1 sister (Alice's aunt) who doesn't have children    - This aunt has 6 nephews and nieces in total  3. On Alice's father's side:    - Father has 2 sisters    - Father has 1 brother who has 5 nephews and nieces, and 1 son  4. To find Alice's sister's cousins, we need to count the children of Alice's aunts and uncles:    - Mother's side:       * 2 uncles, but we don't know how many children they have    - Father's side:      * 2 aunts, but we don't know how many children they have      * 1 uncle who has 1 son  5. The key information is:    - Alice's aunt (mother's sister) has 6 nephews and nieces    - Alice and her 3 siblings account for 4 of these    - So, Alice's mother's brothers must have 2 children in total (6 - 4 = 2)  6. On the father's side:    - Alice's uncle has 5 nephews and nieces    - Alice and her 3 siblings account for 4 of these    - The uncle's own son accounts for 1    - So, Alice's father's sisters must have no children (5 - 4 - 1 = 0)  7. Counting the cousins:    - Mother's side: 2 cousins (from mother's brothers)    - Father's side: 1 cousin (from father's brother)  8.
