        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's interpret the information carefully and reconstruct Alice's family structure step by step.  1. **Alice's Immediate Family:**    - Alice has **3 sisters**, making a total of **4 daughters** in her immediate family.  2. **Maternal Side:**    - **Alice's Mother** has:      - **1 sister** who **does not have children**.      - **2 brothers** (Uncle A and Uncle B).    - The childless sister (Alice's aunt) has **6 nephews and nieces**. These are the children of her siblings (Alice's mother and her two brothers).    - Since Alice's mother has **4 daughters**, the remaining **2 nephews\/nieces** must be the children of the two brothers.    - Therefore, **Uncle A and Uncle B** have **2 children between them** (collectively).  3. **Paternal Side:**    - **Alice's Father** has:      - **1 brother** (Uncle C) who has:        - **1 son**.        - **4 nephews and nieces**, who are the children of his sibling(s).
