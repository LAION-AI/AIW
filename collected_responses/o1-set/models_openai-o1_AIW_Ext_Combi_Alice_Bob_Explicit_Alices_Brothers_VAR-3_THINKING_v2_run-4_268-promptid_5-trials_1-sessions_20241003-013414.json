This means **besides herself**, there is one other sister. So, there are **2 sisters** in total. 3. **Bob has 4 brothers**. This means **besides himself**, there are four other brothers. So, there are **5 brothers** in total. 4. The total number of children in the family is **2 sisters + 5 brothers = 7 children**. 5. **Alice's brothers** are all the male siblings in the family. Since there are **5 brothers**, Alice has **5 brothers**.  ### Answer: 5",
