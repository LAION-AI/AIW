Alice's Immediate Family:** - Alice has a total of 4 siblings: 2 sisters and 1 brother (including herself, that makes 4 children in total).  **2. Mother's Side:** - Alice's mother has 2 brothers and 1 sister. - The mother's sister does not have children, but she has 6 nephews and nieces. These nephews and nieces are the children of the mother's brothers. - Since there are 2 maternal uncles and a total of 6 nephews and nieces, each uncle has 3 children. - Therefore, from the mother's side, there are **6 cousins** (3 from each uncle).  **3. Father's Side:** - Alice's father has 2 sisters and 1 brother. - The father's brother has 4 nephews and nieces and also has 1 son. - The 4 nephews and nieces include his own son and the children of his two sisters. - Since the brother has 1 son, and there are 3 other nephews and nieces, it implies that each sister has 1 child (total of 2 children from the sisters). - Therefore, from the father's side, there are **4 cousins** (1 from the brother's own son and 3 from his sisters).  **4.

These nephews and nieces must come from the children of the other siblings (Alice and her brother).  3. **Children of Siblings:**    - Since there are 6 nephews and nieces from Alice and her brother, it implies that Alice and her brother have a combined total of 6 children.  4. **Uncles and Aunts:**    - On the mother's side, there are 2 brothers (maternal uncles).    - On the father's side, there are 2 sisters (aunts) and 1 brother (paternal uncle).    - The paternal uncle has 1 son.  5. **Cousins Calculation:**    - The cousins come from the children of the maternal uncles and paternal aunts\/uncles.    - From the father's side, the paternal uncle has 1 son, contributing 1 cousin.    - The remaining cousins come from the maternal uncles. Since there are 6 nephews and nieces from Alice's side, it's logical to deduce that there are 5 more cousins from the maternal uncles to make a total of 6.  **Conclusion:** Alice's sister has a total of **6 cousins**.  ### Answer: 6",

Given: - Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother. - Alice's mother has 2 brothers. - Alice's mother has 1 sister who does not have children and has 6 nephews and nieces in total. - Alice's father has 2 sisters. - Alice's father has a brother who has 4 nephews and nieces in total, and who also has 1 son.  Step 1: Determine the number of cousins from Alice's mother's side. - Alice's mother has 2 brothers, and their children will be Alice's sister's cousins. - The total number of nephews and nieces of Alice's mother's sister is 6, which includes Alice, her 2 sisters, and her brother. - So, the number of cousins from Alice's mother's side is 6 - 4 = 2.  Step 2: Determine the number of cousins from Alice's father's side. - Alice's father has 2 sisters, and their children will be Alice's sister's cousins. - Alice's father's brother has 1 son, who is also Alice's sister's cousin. - The total number of nephews and nieces of Alice's father's brother is 4, which includes Alice, her 2 sisters, and her brother. - So, the number of cousins from Alice's father's brother is 4 - 4 = 0.  Step 3: Calculate the total number of cousins Alice's sister has. Total number of cousins = Cousins from mother's side + Cousins from father's side + Son of father's brother Total number of cousins = 2 + 0 + 1 = 3  Double-checking the solution: - The total number of cousins from Alice's mother's side (2) and father's side (0) is correct based on the given information. - The son of Alice's father's brother is correctly counted as an additional cousin. - The calculation of the total number of cousins is accurate.

        "model_response":"Let's think through this step-by-step:  1. First, let's identify Alice's siblings:    - Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother  2. Now, let's look at Alice's mother's side:    - Mother has 2 brothers    - Mother has 1 sister (Alice's aunt) who has no children    - This aunt has 6 nephews and nieces in total  3. On Alice's father's side:    - Father has 2 sisters    - Father has 1 brother who has 4 nephews and nieces, and 1 son  4. To find Alice's sister's cousins, we need to count the children of Alice's aunts and uncles:    - Mother's side:       * 2 uncles, but we don't know how many children they have    - Father's side:      * 2 aunts, but we don't know how many children they have      * 1 uncle who has 1 son  5. The key information is:    - Alice's aunt (mother's sister) has 6 nephews and nieces    - Alice's uncle (father's brother) has 4 nephews and nieces  6. Let's break this down:    - The 6 nephews and nieces of Alice's aunt include Alice, her 2 sisters, and her brother (4 total)    - This means there are 2 more, which must be children of Alice's mother's brothers        - The 4 nephews and nieces of Alice's uncle include Alice, her 2 sisters, and her brother    - This means Alice's father's sisters don't have any children  7. So, the total number of cousins:    - 2 from mother's side (children of mother's brothers)    - 1 from father's side (son of father's brother)  Therefore, Alice's sister has 3 cousins in total.  ### Answer: 3",

On Alice's father's side:    - Father has 2 sisters    - Father has 1 brother who has 4 nephews\/nieces and 1 son  4.

We know that Alice's father's brother has 4 nephews\/nieces in total. This includes:    - Alice and her 3 siblings (4 in total)     So, this uncle doesn't have any other children besides the 1 son we already counted.  6. We also know that Alice's mother's sister (aunt) has 6 nephews\/nieces. This must include:    - Alice and her 3 siblings (4 in total)    - The 2 children of Alice's mother's brothers (to make up the total of 6)  7.

We're given two pieces of information about nephews and nieces:    - Alice's mother's sister (aunt) has 6 nephews and nieces    - Alice's father's brother (uncle) has 4 nephews and nieces  6. The 6 nephews and nieces of Alice's aunt include:    - Alice and her 3 siblings (4 in total)    - The children of Alice's mother's 2 brothers (unknown number)  7. The 4 nephews and nieces of Alice's uncle include:    - Alice and her 3 siblings (4 in total)  8. From this, we can conclude that Alice's mother's brothers don't have any children, as they're not needed to make up the 6 nephews and nieces mentioned.  9.
