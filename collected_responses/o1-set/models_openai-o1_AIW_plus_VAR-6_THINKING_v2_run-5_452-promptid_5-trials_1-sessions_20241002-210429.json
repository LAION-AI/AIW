        "model_response":"To solve this problem step by step:  1. **Alice's Family**:    - Alice has **2 sisters**, totaling **3 siblings** (Alice + 2 sisters).    - From additional information, Alice also has a **brother** (since her father's brother has 4 nephews and nieces, and Alice's immediate family needs to account for these).  2. **Maternal Side**:    - **Alice's Mother** has **1 sister** (with no children) and **2 brothers**.    - The sister (Alice's aunt) has **6 nephews and nieces** (children of her siblings).    - Since Alice's mother has **4 children**, the **2 maternal uncles** must have a combined total of **2 children** (6 total nephews and nieces - 4 from Alice's mother = 2 from uncles).    - So, Alice has **2 cousins** on her mother's side.  3. **Paternal Side**:    - **Alice's Father** has **1 brother**.    - This brother has **2 daughters**.    - He has **4 nephews and nieces** (children of his siblings).    - Since Alice's father has **4 children**, these are the **nieces and nephews** mentioned.    - So, Alice has **2 cousins** on her father's side.  4. **Total Cousins**:    - **2 maternal cousins** + **2 paternal cousins** = **4 cousins**.  ### Answer: 4",

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's break down the family relationships step by step.  **Alice's Immediate Family:** - Alice has **2 sisters**, so Alice's parents have **3 daughters** in total (including Alice).  **Maternal Side:** - Alice's mother has:   - **1 sister (Aunt M)** who has **no children**.   - **2 brothers (Uncle 1 and Uncle 2)**. - Aunt M has **6 nephews and nieces**. - These nephews and nieces are the children of her siblings since she has no children. - Alice's mother has **3 daughters** (Alice and her sisters), so that's **3 nieces** to Aunt M. - The two brothers must then have a total of **3 children** (because 6 nephews and nieces minus the 3 from Alice's mother equals 3). - Therefore, **Alice has 3 maternal cousins** from her uncles.  **Paternal Side:** - Alice's father has:   - **1 brother (Paternal Uncle)** who has **2 daughters**.   - **1 other sibling (Paternal Aunt)** who has **1 child**. - Paternal Uncle has **4 nephews and nieces**. - These are:   - **3 daughters** from Alice's father (Alice and her sisters).   - **1 child** from the Paternal Aunt. - Therefore, **Paternal Uncle's siblings have 4 children in total**, matching the given information. - Alice has **3 paternal cousins** (2 from Paternal Uncle and 1 from Paternal Aunt).  **Total Cousins:** - **Maternal cousins:** 3 - **Paternal cousins:** 3 - **Total cousins Alice's sister has:** **3 + 3 = 6**  ### Answer: 6",

Since she has no children, these are the children of her siblings (Alice's mother and her two brothers).  3. **Alice's Mother** has **Alice, her 2 sisters, and a brother** (implied to account for the correct total of nephews and nieces). So, Alice's mother has **4 children**.  4. The **2 maternal uncles** together have **2 children** (since 6 nephews and nieces minus 4 from Alice's mother equals 2).
