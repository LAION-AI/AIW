These are the children of her siblings (Alice's mother and her two brothers). - Alice's mother has 5 children (Alice, her sister, and 3 brothers). - Therefore, B1 and B2 together have **1 child** (since 6 total nieces and nephews minus 5 children from Alice's mother equals 1 child from B1 and B2). - So, from the maternal side, Alice's sister has **1 cousin** (the child of B1 and B2).  **Paternal Side:** - Alice's father has:   - 2 sisters (S2 and S3) who have no children   - 1 brother (B3) who has 1 daughter - B3 has 3 nephews and 2 nieces, which are the children of his siblings (Alice's father, S2, and S3). - Alice's father has 5 children (Alice, her sister, and 3 brothers). - Therefore, from the paternal side, Alice's sister has **1 cousin** (B3's daughter).  **Total Cousins:** - Maternal cousins: 1 - Paternal cousins: 1 - **Total cousins Alice's sister has: 1 + 1 = 2**  ### Answer: 2",

Now, let's look at Alice's mother's side:    - Alice's mother has 2 brothers    - Alice's mother has 1 sister who doesn't have children    - This sister has 4 nephews and 2 nieces (which matches the 5 children Alice's parents have)    - So, Alice's mother's brothers don't have children (as the nephews and nieces are accounted for)  3.

From the mother's side:    - The childless aunt mentions having 4 nephews and 2 nieces in total    - This matches exactly with Alice and her siblings (1 sister + 3 brothers + Alice = 5 children)    - So, Alice's mother's brothers don't seem to have any children  6.

Now, let's look at the children of these aunts and uncles:    - Mother's sister: No children    - Father's brother: 1 daughter  3. We're not given direct information about the children of the other aunts and uncles, but we can deduce some information:    - Mother's sister has 4 nephews and 2 nieces in total    - Father's brother has 3 nephews and 2 nieces in total  4. We know Alice has 1 sister and 3 brothers, which accounts for 4 of the nephews\/nieces mentioned above.  5. The remaining nephews\/nieces must be Alice's cousins:    - From mother's side: 4 nephews + 2 nieces - 4 (Alice and her siblings) = 2 cousins    - From father's side: 3 nephews + 2 nieces - 4 (Alice and her siblings) + 1 (father's brother's daughter) = 2 cousins  6.
