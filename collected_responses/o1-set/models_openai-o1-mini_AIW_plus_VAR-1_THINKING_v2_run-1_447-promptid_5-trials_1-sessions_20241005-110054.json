        "model_response":"Let's break down the problem step by step to determine how many cousins Alice's sister has.  **1. Understanding the Family Structure:**  - **Alice's Immediate Family:**   - Alice has **2 sisters**. So, there are **3 children** (Alice + 2 sisters) in this generation.  - **Mother's Side:**   - Alice's mother has **1 sister** (aunt) who **does not have children**.   - The aunt has **6 nephews and nieces**.   - Alice's mother also has **2 brothers**.  - **Father's Side:**   - Alice's father has **1 brother** (uncle).   - This uncle has **5 nephews and nieces**.   - The uncle also has **2 daughters**.  **2. Calculating Cousins from the Mother's Side:**  - Since the aunt has no children, the **6 nephews and nieces** must come from her **2 brothers** (Alice's uncles). - Therefore, from the mother's side, there are **6 cousins**.  **3. Calculating Cousins from the Father's Side:**  - The uncle has **2 daughters**, who are direct cousins to Alice and her sisters. - Additionally, the uncle has **5 nephews and nieces**. Since the only siblings on the father's side are the father and this uncle, these **5** include Alice and her **2 sisters**. - Therefore, apart from the uncle's own **2 daughters**, there are no additional cousins from the father's side beyond what's already counted.  **4. Total Cousins:**  - **From Mother's Side:** 6 cousins - **From Father's Side:** 2 cousins (uncle's daughters) - **Total Cousins:** 6 + 2 = **8**  ### Answer: 8",

        "model_response":"To determine how many cousins Alice's sister has, let's break down the information step by step:  1. **Alice's Immediate Family:**    - Alice has 2 sisters. So, there are 3 siblings in total.  2. **Maternal Side:**    - Alice's mother has 1 sister (maternal aunt) who does not have children.    - This maternal aunt has 6 nephews and nieces. Since she has no children, these nephews and nieces must be from her siblings (Alice's mother and her brothers).    - Additionally, the maternal aunt has 2 brothers, meaning Alice's mother has 2 brothers.    - Therefore, the 6 nephews and nieces come from the 2 maternal uncles. This implies that the 2 uncles have a combined total of 6 children.  3. **Paternal Side:**    - Alice's father has a brother (paternal uncle).    - This paternal uncle has 2 daughters.    - He also has a total of 5 nephews and nieces. Since Alice and her 2 sisters are his nephews and nieces, that's 3 from the immediate siblings.    - The remaining 2 nephews and nieces presumably come from other siblings, but given the provided information, we focus on the known 2 daughters.  4. **Calculating Cousins:**    - From the **maternal side**, Alice's sister has **6 cousins** (children of the 2 maternal uncles).    - From the **paternal side**, Alice's sister has **2 cousins** (children of the paternal uncle).  5. **Total Cousins:**    - **6 (maternal) + 2 (paternal) = 8 cousins**.  ### Answer: 8",
