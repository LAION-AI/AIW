This does not include herself, so there are a total of 4 sisters (including Alice).    - **Brothers**: Let's denote the number of brothers Alice has as **B**.  3. **Understanding Bob's Siblings**:    - **Brothers**: Bob has 1 brother. This does not include himself, so there are a total of 2 brothers (including Bob).    - **Sisters**: Since Alice is one of the sisters and there are 3 additional sisters, Bob also has 3 sisters.  4. **Connecting Both Perspectives**:    - From Bob's perspective, there are 2 brothers in total.    - Therefore, Alice must have **2** brothers (Bob and one other brother).  ### Answer: Alice has 2 brothers.",
