        "model_response":"Let's determine how many female friends Alice has.  Firstly, note that all mentioned persons are friends with each other and have no other friends aside. This means that all these persons form a group where everyone is friends with everyone else.   Let's denote: - Total number of people in the group: \\( N \\) - Number of males in the group: \\( M \\) - Number of females in the group: \\( F \\)  From the problem: 1. Alice is female. 2. Bob is male. 3. Alice has 8 male friends. Since all persons are friends with each other, Alice's total number of friends is \\( N - 1 \\) (excluding herself). So her female friends are \\( (N - 1) - 8 \\). 4. Bob has 7 female friends. Similarly, Bob's male friends are \\( (N - 1) - 7 \\). 5. All persons in the group are friends with each other.  Now, Bob's male friends are all males except himself, so: \\[ \\text{Bob's male friends} = M - 1 = (N - 1) - 7 \\] \\[ M - 1 = N - 8 \\] \\[ M = N - 7 \\]  Also, Alice's female friends are all females except herself, so: \\[ \\text{Alice's female friends} = F - 1 = (N - 1) - 8 \\] \\[ F - 1 = N - 9 \\] \\[ F = N - 8 \\]  Since \\( N = M + F \\), substitute \\( M \\) and \\( F \\): \\[ N = (N - 7) + (N - 8) \\] \\[ N = 2N - 15 \\] \\[ N = 15 \\]  Now calculate \\( M \\) and \\( F \\): \\[ M = N - 7 = 15 - 7 = 8 \\] \\[ F = N - 8 = 15 - 8 = 7 \\]  Finally, the number of female friends Alice has is: \\[ \\text{Alice's female friends} = F - 1 = 7 - 1 = 6 \\]  ### Answer: Alice has 6 female friends.",
