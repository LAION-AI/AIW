        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many female friends a male friend of Alice (say, Bob) has. According to the information provided:  1. Alice has 2 male friends and 3 female friends. 2. All of Alice's friends are friends with each other. 3. They have no other friends aside from this group.  Since all of Alice's friends are friends with each other, and Alice is friends with all of them, the male friend (Bob) is friends with:  - The other male friend (Charlie). - The three female friends (Diane, Eve, and Fiona). - Alice herself.  Therefore, Bob has a total of **four female friends**: Alice, Diane, Eve, and Fiona.  ### Answer: 4",
