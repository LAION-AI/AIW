        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's carefully analyze the given information:  1. **Alice has 2 female friends and 4 male friends.** 2. **They all are friends with each other and have no other friends aside.**  First, determine who \"they\" refers to. In this context, \"they\" includes Alice and all her friends since it's logical that Alice is friends with her friends, and the phrase suggests that the entire group is mutually friends with each other and have no other friends outside this group.  So, the total group consists of:  - Alice (female) - 2 female friends - 4 male friends  This makes a group of **7 people** who are all friends with each other.  Now, focus on a **male friend of Alice**. Since everyone in the group is friends with each other:  - The male friend is friends with **Alice**. - He is also friends with the **2 female friends**. - Additionally, he is friends with the **3 other male friends**.  Therefore, the male friend has:  - **3 female friends** (Alice + 2 female friends) - **3 male friends** (the other male friends)  **Answer: 3**",

When considering *one male friend* of Alice, we want to determine how many female friends he has within this network.  - **Female friends in the group**: Alice herself and the 2 other female friends, totaling 3 females. - **Male friend's female friends**: Since everyone is friends with each other within the group, the male friend is friends with all 3 females (Alice and the two female friends).  **Therefore, each male friend has 3 female friends.**  ### Answer: 3",
