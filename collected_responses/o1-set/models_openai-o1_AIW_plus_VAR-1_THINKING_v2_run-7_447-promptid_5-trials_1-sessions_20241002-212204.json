        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we'll carefully reconstruct Alice's family tree:  1. **Alice and Her Siblings**: Alice has 2 sisters, so there are 3 siblings in her immediate family.  2. **Maternal Side**:    - **Alice's Mother** has:      - **1 Sister** (Alice's aunt) who **does not have children**.      - **2 Brothers** (Alice's uncles).    - The aunt (who has no children) has **6 nephews and nieces**. Since she has no children, these must be the children of her siblings:      - Alice and her sisters account for 3 nieces\/nephews (from Alice's mother).      - Therefore, the 2 brothers must have **3 children** in total (6 nephews\/nieces - 3 from Alice's mother = 3).    - **Maternal Cousins**: Alice's maternal cousins are the 3 children of her mother's brothers.  3. **Paternal Side**:    - **Alice's Father** has:      - **1 Brother** who has **2 daughters** (Alice's cousins).      - The brother has **5 nephews and nieces**.

Since she doesn't have children, these are her siblings' children. - Alice's mother has three daughters (Alice and her two sisters), accounting for 3 nieces. - Therefore, the two brothers must have 3 children collectively. - **Total maternal cousins:** 3 (from the two maternal uncles).  **Paternal Side:** - Alice's father has a brother who has 2 daughters. - This brother has 5 nephews and nieces, which are the children of his siblings. - Alice's father has three daughters, accounting for 3 nieces\/nephews. - There must be another sibling of Alice's father who has 2 children (since 5 - 3 = 2). - **Total paternal cousins:** 2 (from the brother with 2 daughters) + 2 (from the other sibling) = 4.  **Total Cousins:** - **Maternal cousins:** 3 - **Paternal cousins:** 4 - **Total cousins:** 3 + 4 = **7**  ### Answer: 7",

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's break down the family relationships step by step.  **Alice's Family:** 1. **Alice has 2 sisters**, so there are 3 daughters in her immediate family (Alice and her 2 sisters).  **Mother's Side:** 1. **Alice's mother has 1 sister (Aunt A)** who **does not have children**. 2. Aunt A has **6 nephews and nieces**, which are the children of her siblings since she has no children herself. 3.

Therefore, **Alice has 4 cousins on her father's side** (2 daughters of Uncle D and 2 children of Uncle E\/Aunt B).  **Total Cousins:** - **3 cousins from her mother's side**. - **4 cousins from her father's side**. - **Total cousins = 3 + 4 = 7**.  ### Answer: 7",
