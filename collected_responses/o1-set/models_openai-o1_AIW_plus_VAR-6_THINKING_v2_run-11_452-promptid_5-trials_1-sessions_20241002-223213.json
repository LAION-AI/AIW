Alice's Immediate Family:** - Alice has **2 sisters**, so there are **3 siblings** in total (Alice and her 2 sisters). - However, based on the information provided later, we realize that Alice must also have a **brother**. This is because Alice's paternal uncle (her father's brother) has **4 nephews and nieces**, and since he and Alice's father are the only siblings mentioned, these 4 nephews and nieces must all be Alice and her siblings. Therefore, Alice's father has **4 children** (Alice, her 2 sisters, and a brother).  **2.
