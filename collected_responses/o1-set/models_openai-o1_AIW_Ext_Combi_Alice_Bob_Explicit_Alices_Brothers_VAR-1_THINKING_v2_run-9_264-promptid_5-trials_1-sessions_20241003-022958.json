Since Alice herself is a sister, this means there are a total of \\( 3 + 1 = 4 \\) sisters in the family. 3. **Bob has 6 brothers**. Including Bob himself, this means there are \\( 6 + 1 = 7 \\) brothers in the family.  Now, since Alice is a sister, the number of brothers she has is equal to the total number of brothers in the family. Therefore, **Alice has 7 brothers**.  ### Answer: 7",

Now, we have: - Total number of sisters (girls) in the family: **4** - Total number of brothers (boys) in the family: **7** - Total number of siblings: **4 sisters + 7 brothers = 11 siblings**  **Since Alice is one of the sisters, the number of brothers she has is equal to the total number of brothers in the family:**  **Answer: 7**",
