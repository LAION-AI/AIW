        "model_response":"Let's think through this problem step by step:  1. Alice has 1 sister and 3 brothers, which means her parents have a total of 5 children (including Alice).  2. Alice's mother has 2 brothers. We don't know if these brothers have children, so we can't count any cousins from this side yet.  3. Alice's mother also has 1 sister who does not have children. This sister has 6 nephews and nieces in total. Since Alice's mother has 5 children, and her sister doesn't have any, these 6 nephews and nieces must be the children of Alice's mother's 2 brothers. So, Alice and her siblings have 6 cousins from their mother's side.  4. Alice's father has 2 sisters. We don't know if these sisters have children, so we can't count any cousins from them yet.  5. Alice's father also has a brother who has 5 nephews and nieces in total, and who also has 1 daughter. Since Alice's father has 5 children (including Alice), the 5 nephews and nieces must be Alice and her siblings. The 1 daughter of Alice's father's brother is Alice's cousin. So, Alice and her siblings have 1 cousin from their father's side.  6. In total, Alice and her siblings have 6 cousins from their mother's side and 1 cousin from their father's side. Therefore, Alice's sister has 7 cousins in total.  Double-checking the solution: - The 6 nephews and nieces of Alice's mother's sister must be the children of Alice's mother's 2 brothers, as Alice's mother's sister doesn't have children. - The 5 nephews and nieces of Alice's father's brother must be Alice and her siblings, as they are the only children of Alice's father. - The 1 daughter of Alice's father's brother is a cousin to Alice and her siblings.  The solution appears to be correct.  ### Answer: Alice's sister has 7 cousins.",

Alice's father also has a brother who has 5 nephews and nieces in total, and who also has 1 daughter. This means that the brother has 6 children in total (5 nephews\/nieces + 1 daughter).  6.

Alice's mother has 2 brothers.    - We don't know if these brothers have any children. 3. Alice's mother also has 1 sister who does not have children.    - This sister has 6 nephews and nieces in total.    - Since Alice's mother has 5 children, and her sister doesn't have any, these 6 nephews and nieces must come from the 2 brothers mentioned in step 2. 4.

Now, let's count the cousins of Alice's sister: - From step 3, we know that Alice's mother's 2 brothers have 6 children in total. These are cousins of Alice's sister. - From step 5, we know that Alice's father's brother has 1 daughter, who is also a cousin of Alice's sister. - We don't have enough information about the children of Alice's father's 2 sisters, so we can't include them in the count.  Therefore, the total number of cousins of Alice's sister that we can count is 6 (from her mother's side) + 1 (from her father's side) = 7.

        "model_response":"To find out how many cousins Alice's sister has, let's break down the information given and solve the problem step by step.  Given: - Alice has 1 sister and 3 brothers. - Alice's mother has 2 brothers. - Alice's mother has 1 sister who does not have children and has 6 nephews and nieces in total. - Alice's father has 2 sisters. - Alice's father has a brother who has 5 nephews and nieces in total and 1 daughter.  Step 1: Determine the number of cousins from Alice's mother's side. - Alice's mother has 2 brothers, but we don't know how many children they have. - Alice's mother's sister does not have children, so she does not contribute to the number of cousins.  Step 2: Determine the number of cousins from Alice's father's side. - Alice's father has 2 sisters, but we don't know how many children they have. - Alice's father's brother has 1 daughter, who is Alice's cousin. - Alice's father's brother has 5 nephews and nieces in total, including his own daughter. This means that the remaining 4 nephews and nieces are Alice's cousins.  Step 3: Calculate the total number of known cousins. - From Alice's father's side: 1 cousin (father's brother's daughter) + 4 cousins (father's brother's other nephews and nieces) = 5 cousins  Step 4: Check for any missing information. - We don't know the number of children Alice's mother's brothers have. - We don't know the number of children Alice's father's sisters have.
