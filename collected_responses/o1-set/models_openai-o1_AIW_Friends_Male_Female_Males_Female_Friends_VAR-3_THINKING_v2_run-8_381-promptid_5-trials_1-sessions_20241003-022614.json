This means:  - M1 is friends with F1, F2, F3, F4, and Alice. - Each of the female friends (F1-F4) are friends with M1 and each other.  From point 3, **they have no other friends outside this group**.  Now, we need to determine **how many female friends the male friend (M1) has**. Since M1 is friends with:  - **Alice** (female) - **F1** (female) - **F2** (female) - **F3** (female) - **F4** (female)  M1 has **5 friends**, and all of them are female.  ### Answer: 5",
