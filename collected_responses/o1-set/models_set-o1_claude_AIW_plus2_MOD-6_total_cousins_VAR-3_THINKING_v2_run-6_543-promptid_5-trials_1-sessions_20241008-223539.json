        "model_response":"Let's think through this step-by-step:  1. First, we need to identify Alice's cousins. Cousins are the children of Alice's aunts and uncles.  2.

From Alice's father's side:    - Her father has 2 sisters    - Her father has 1 brother, who has 1 son  4. Now, let's count the cousins:    - From mother's side: We don't know if the 2 brothers have children, so we can't count any cousins from this side yet.    - From father's side: We know his brother has 1 son, so that's 1 cousin.  5. We need to find more information about the cousins. Let's look at the additional details:    - Alice's mother's sister (who doesn't have children) has 3 nephews and 4 nieces in total.    - Alice's father's brother has 1 nephew and 4 nieces in total.  6. The information about Alice's father's brother is crucial:    - He has 1 nephew (which is likely Alice's brother) and 4 nieces (which are likely Alice and her 2 sisters, plus 1 more).    - This means Alice's father's sisters together have 1 daughter (the additional niece).  7. So, we can now count the cousins:    - 1 son from Alice's father's brother    - 1 daughter from Alice's father's sisters  8. Therefore, Alice has 2 cousins in total.  9. The question asks how many cousins Alice's sister has. Since Alice and her siblings share the same cousins, Alice's sister also has 2 cousins.  ### Answer: 2",

Step 1: Determine the number of cousins from Alice's mother's side. - Alice's mother has 2 brothers, but we don't know how many children they have. - We can't determine the number of cousins from this information.  Step 2: Determine the number of cousins from Alice's father's side. - Alice's father has 2 sisters, but we don't know how many children they have. - Alice's father has a brother who has 1 son (Alice's cousin).  Step 3: Check the total number of nephews and nieces mentioned. - Alice's mother's sister has 3 nephews and 4 nieces in total, which adds up to 7. - Alice's father's brother has 1 nephew and 4 nieces in total, which adds up to 5. - In total, there are 7 + 5 = 12 nephews and nieces mentioned.  Step 4: Compare the total number of nephews and nieces with Alice's siblings. - Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother, which adds up to 3 siblings. - The total number of nephews and nieces (12) is greater than the number of Alice's siblings (3). - This means that some of the nephews and nieces mentioned are not Alice's siblings, but rather her cousins.

Double-checking the solution: - The given information is insufficient to determine the exact number of cousins Alice's sister has. - However, we can confidently say that Alice's sister has at least 1 cousin (her father's brother's son). - The number of nephews and nieces mentioned exceeds the number of Alice's siblings, indicating that some of them are cousins, but we cannot determine the exact number.  ### Answer: Alice's sister has at least 1 cousin.",
