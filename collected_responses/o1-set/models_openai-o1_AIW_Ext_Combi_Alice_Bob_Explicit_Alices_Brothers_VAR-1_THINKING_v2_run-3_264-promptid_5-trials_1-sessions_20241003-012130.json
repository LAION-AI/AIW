        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's carefully analyze the information given step by step:  1. **Alice and Bob are siblings**, with Alice being a sister and Bob being a brother.     2. **Alice has 3 sisters**. Since this count doesn't include herself (as per common usage), there are a total of **4 sisters** in the family (Alice plus her 3 sisters).  3. **Bob has 6 brothers**. Similarly, this count doesn't include himself, so there are a total of **7 brothers** in the family (Bob plus his 6 brothers).  4. **Total number of siblings in the family**: Adding the total number of sisters and brothers gives us \\(4 \\text{ sisters} + 7 \\text{ brothers} = 11 \\text{ children}\\).  5. **Number of brothers Alice has**: All the boys in the family are Alice's brothers. Since there are **7 brothers**, **Alice has 7 brothers**.  ### Answer: 7",
