        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's break down the family relationships step by step:  **Alice's Family:** - Alice has **3 sisters**, so there are **4 siblings** in total (including Alice).  **Maternal Side:** - Alice's mother has:   - **1 sister** who **does not have children**.   - This sister has **6 nephews and nieces**. Since she has no children, these nephews and nieces are the children of her siblings.   - Alice's mother also has **2 brothers** (Alice's maternal uncles).  - The **6 nephews and nieces** are:   - **Alice and her 3 sisters** (**4 nieces\/nephews**).   - The children of the **2 maternal uncles**.    - Therefore, the **2 maternal uncles** have a total of **2 children** (since 6 total nephews\/nieces - 4 from Alice's family = 2 from the uncles).  **Paternal Side:** - Alice's father has:   - **1 brother** who has **1 son** (Alice's cousin).   - This brother has **4 nephews and nieces**. These are the children of his sibling(s).  - Since the brother has **4 nephews and nieces**, and Alice's father has only one brother (no other siblings are mentioned), these nephews and nieces are **Alice and her 3 sisters**.  **Total Cousins:** - From the **maternal side**: **2 cousins** (children of the maternal uncles). - From the **paternal side**: **1 cousin** (son of the paternal uncle). - **Total**: **2 + 1 = 3 cousins**.  ### Answer: 3",

Since there are 2 brothers and 2 nieces\/nephews, each brother likely has **1 child**.

        "model_response":"We are to determine how many cousins Alice's sister has.  Let's map out the family relationships step by step.  1. **Alice's Immediate Family:**    - Alice has 3 sisters, so there are 4 daughters in Alice's family.  2. **Alice's Maternal Side:**    - Alice's mother has:      - 1 sister who **does not have children**.      - 2 brothers.    - Alice's mother's sister (Alice's aunt) has **6 nephews and nieces**. Since she has no children, these must be the children of her siblings (Alice's mother and her two brothers).      - Alice's mother has 4 children (Alice and her sisters).      - Therefore, Alice's maternal uncles (her mother's brothers) must have **2 children total** (since 6 nephews\/nieces - 4 from Alice's mother = 2 from the brothers).  3. **Alice's Paternal Side:**    - Alice's father has a brother who:      - **Has 1 son** (Alice's cousin).      - Has **4 nephews and nieces**. These are the children of his siblings. Assuming Alice's father has no other siblings besides this brother, the 4 nephews\/nieces are Alice and her three sisters.  4. **Counting Alice's Cousins:**    - From her mother's side, Alice has **2 cousins** (children of her maternal uncles).    - From her father's side, Alice has **1 cousin** (son of her paternal uncle).    - **Total cousins = 2 (maternal) + 1 (paternal) = 3 cousins**.
