Counting Alice's cousins:    * From Alice's mother's side:      - Her 2 brothers have 3 nephews and 4 nieces in total.      - Since Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother, the 3 nephews and 4 nieces are Alice and her siblings.      - Therefore, Alice has no cousins from her mother's side.     * From Alice's father's side:      - His 2 sisters have no information about their children, so we cannot count any cousins from them.      - His brother has 1 son, who is Alice's cousin.      - The brother also has 1 nephew and 4 nieces, but they are not Alice's cousins, as they are the brother's grandchildren.  5. In total, Alice has 1 cousin (her father's brother's son).  Since the question asks about Alice's sister's cousins, and all siblings share the same cousins, Alice's sister also has 1 cousin.  Double-checking the solution: * Alice's mother's side doesn't contribute to the cousin count. * Alice's father's brother's son is the only confirmed cousin. * The information about the father's brother's grandchildren is irrelevant for counting Alice's cousins.

        "model_response":"To find out how many cousins Alice's sister has, we need to count the children of Alice's aunts and uncles.  Alice's mother's side: - Alice's mother has 2 brothers, but we don't know how many children they have. - Alice's mother has 1 sister who does not have children.  Alice's father's side: - Alice's father has 2 sisters, but we don't know how many children they have. - Alice's father has 1 brother who has 1 son.  Now, let's analyze the given information about the total number of nephews and nieces: - Alice's aunt (mother's sister) has 3 nephews and 4 nieces in total. - Alice's uncle (father's brother) has 1 nephew and 4 nieces in total.  To determine the number of cousins Alice's sister has, we need to find the total number of children of Alice's aunts and uncles, excluding Alice and her siblings.  Total nephews and nieces of Alice's aunt (mother's sister): 3 nephews + 4 nieces = 7 This includes Alice, her 2 sisters, and her 1 brother, so we subtract them. 7 - (1 + 2 + 1) = 3 cousins from Alice's mother's side  Total nephews and nieces of Alice's uncle (father's brother): 1 nephew + 4 nieces = 5 We know that Alice's uncle has 1 son, so the remaining 4 must be Alice and her siblings. 5 - (1 son + 1 Alice + 2 sisters + 1 brother) = 0 cousins from Alice's father's brother  Therefore, the total number of cousins Alice's sister has is: 3 (from mother's side) + 0 (from father's brother) = 3 cousins  However, we don't have information about the children of Alice's father's 2 sisters, so there might be additional cousins that we cannot count with the given information.  ### Answer: Based on the given information, Alice's sister has at least 3 cousins, but there might be more cousins from Alice's father's sisters that cannot be determined with the available data.",

        "model_response":"To find out how many cousins Alice's sister has, let's break down the information given and analyze it step by step.  Given: - Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother. - Alice's mother has 2 brothers. - Alice's mother has 1 sister who does not have children and has 3 nephews and 4 nieces in total. - Alice's father has 2 sisters. - Alice's father has a brother who has 1 nephew, 4 nieces, and 1 son.  Step 1: Determine the number of cousins from Alice's mother's side. - Alice's mother has 2 brothers, but the number of their children is not mentioned. - Alice's mother's sister does not have children, so she does not contribute to the number of cousins.  Step 2: Determine the number of cousins from Alice's father's side. - Alice's father has 2 sisters, but the number of their children is not mentioned. - Alice's father's brother has 1 son, who is a cousin to Alice and her siblings.  Step 3: Calculate the total number of cousins mentioned in the problem. - Alice's father's brother has 1 nephew and 4 nieces, which adds up to 5 cousins for Alice and her siblings. - However, these 5 cousins are already included in the total count of Alice and her siblings (2 sisters and 1 brother).  Step 4: Determine the number of cousins Alice's sister has. - Since we don't have information about the number of children Alice's mother's brothers and father's sisters have, we cannot determine the exact number of cousins Alice's sister has. - The only confirmed cousin is Alice's father's brother's son.  After carefully analyzing the problem, we can conclude that there is not enough information to determine the exact number of cousins Alice's sister has. The problem only confirms 1 cousin (Alice's father's brother's son), but there might be more cousins from Alice's mother's brothers and father's sisters, whose numbers are not specified.  ### Answer: There is not enough information to determine the exact number of cousins Alice's sister has.
