        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of female friends that each male friend of Alice has.  **Step 1: Identify the Group**  - Total people involved: Alice, her 5 female friends, and her 3 male friends, for a total of 9 people. - According to the problem, *they all are friends with each other*, which includes Alice and all her friends.  **Step 2: Focus on One Male Friend**  - Let's consider one of Alice's male friends (let's call him Bob). - Since they all are friends with each other, Bob is friends with:   - Alice   - The 5 female friends   - The 2 other male friends  **Step 3: Count Bob's Female Friends**  - Bob's female friends are:   - Alice (who is female)   - The 5 female friends - Total female friends: 1 (Alice) + 5 = **6**  ### Answer: 6",
