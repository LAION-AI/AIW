        "model_response":"Let's approach this problem step by step to ensure we find the correct answer.  Given: - Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother. - Alice's mother has 2 brothers. - Alice's mother has 1 sister who does not have children and has 6 nephews and nieces in total. - Alice's father has 2 sisters. - Alice's father has a brother who has 5 nephews and nieces in total and 1 son.  Step 1: Determine the number of cousins from Alice's mother's side. - Alice's mother's brothers' children are Alice's cousins. - The total number of Alice's mother's nephews and nieces is 6. - Since Alice's mother's sister doesn't have children, all 6 must be from her 2 brothers. So, Alice has 6 cousins from her mother's side.  Step 2: Determine the number of cousins from Alice's father's side. - Alice's father's sisters' children are Alice's cousins. - Alice's father's brother has 1 son, who is also Alice's cousin. - The total number of Alice's father's nephews and nieces is 5. - Since Alice's father's brother has 1 son, the remaining 4 must be from his 2 sisters. So, Alice has 4 cousins from her father's sisters and 1 cousin from her father's brother, making it a total of 5 cousins from her father's side.  Step 3: Calculate the total number of Alice's cousins. Total cousins = Cousins from mother's side + Cousins from father's side Total cousins = 6 + 5 = 11  Step 4: Determine the number of cousins Alice's sister has. - Alice's sister has the same number of cousins as Alice. So, Alice's sister has 11 cousins.  Double-checking the solution: - The given information is used correctly. - The calculations for each step are accurate. - The final answer is consistent with the problem statement.  ### Answer: Alice's sister has 11 cousins.",

        "model_response":"Let's break down the problem step by step to determine how many cousins Alice's sister has.  1. **Alice's Immediate Family:**    - **Siblings:** Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother, making a total of 4 children in her immediate family.    - **Childless Sister:** One of the sisters does not have children but has 6 nephews and nieces. These nephews and nieces must come from the other siblings (including herself if she has children).  2. **Children in the Family:**    - Since one sister is childless, the 6 nephews and nieces come from the other three siblings: Alice, the other sister, and the brother. Therefore, Alice, her sister, and her brother have 6 children in total.  3. **Alice's Father's Side:**    - **Aunts and Uncles:** Alice's father has 2 sisters and 1 brother.    - **Uncle's Information:** The brother (uncle) has 5 nephews and nieces through his siblings and has 1 son of his own.    - **Total Cousins from Father's Side:** The uncle's 5 nephews and nieces likely come from Alice and her siblings (totaling 6 children) and his own son. However, considering overlap, it's reasonable to conclude there are 6 cousins from the father's side.  4. **Alice's Mother's Side:**    - **Uncles:** Alice's mother has 2 brothers. The problem does not provide information about their children, so we assume they have no children contributing to the cousin count.  5. **Total Cousins:**    - Adding up the cousins from the father's side, there are **6 cousins** in total.  ### Answer: 6",
