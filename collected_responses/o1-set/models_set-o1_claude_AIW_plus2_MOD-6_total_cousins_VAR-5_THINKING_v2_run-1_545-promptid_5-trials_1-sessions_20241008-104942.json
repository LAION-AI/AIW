So, B1 has 2 sons.      - **Nieces:** These are the daughters of her sister S2. So, S2 has 4 daughters.  3. **Uncle (Father's Brother):**    - The father has 1 brother (Uncle3) who has:      - **1 Son:** This is Alice's cousin.      - **1 Nephew and 4 Nieces:** These are from the children of S1, S2, and B1. However, since S1 does not have children, these nephews and nieces must come from B1 and S2.      - This aligns with S1 having 2 nephews (from B1) and 4 nieces (from S2).  4. **Total Cousins:**    - From the siblings, there are:      - 2 nephews (sons of B1)      - 4 nieces (daughters of S2)    - Additionally, Uncle3 has 1 son, who is another cousin.    - Therefore, the total number of cousins is **7**.  ### Answer: 7",

Alice's siblings:    - Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother.    - This means Alice's sister has 1 sister (Alice) and 1 brother.  2. Alice's mother's side:    - Alice's mother has 2 brothers and 1 sister.    - The sister does not have children.    - The sister has 2 nephews and 4 nieces in total.    - Since Alice's mother's sister doesn't have children, these nephews and nieces must be from Alice's mother's brothers.    - Therefore, Alice and her siblings have 6 cousins (2 nephews + 4 nieces) from their mother's side.  3. Alice's father's side:    - Alice's father has 2 sisters and 1 brother.    - The brother has 1 nephew and 4 nieces in total, and also has 1 son.    - The brother's son is Alice and her siblings' cousin.    - The 1 nephew and 4 nieces mentioned are not related to Alice and her siblings, as they are the brother's nephews and nieces, not Alice's father's.    - Therefore, Alice and her siblings have 3 cousins (1 from the brother and 2 from the sisters, assuming each sister has 1 child) from their father's side.  4. Total number of cousins:    - Alice's sister has the same number of cousins as Alice.    - The total number of cousins is the sum of cousins from the mother's side and the father's side.    - Cousins from mother's side = 6    - Cousins from father's side = 3    - Total cousins = 6 + 3 = 9  Let's double-check the calculation: - Alice's sister has 6 cousins from her mother's side (2 nephews + 4 nieces from her mother's brothers). - Alice's sister has 3 cousins from her father's side (1 from her father's brother and 2 from her father's sisters). - In total, Alice's sister has 6 + 3 = 9 cousins.  The calculation appears to be correct.  ### Answer: Alice's sister has 9 cousins.",
