        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's follow these steps carefully:  1. **Identify the social network**:    - **Alice** herself.    - **2 female friends**: Let's call them F1 and F2.    - **4 male friends**: Let's call them M1, M2, M3, and M4.  2. **Understand the relationships**:    - **They all are friends with each other**, including Alice. This means:      - Every person knows every other person in this group.    - **They have no other friends aside**: Their social circle is limited to these 7 people.  3. **Focus on a male friend of Alice**:    - Let's pick **M1** (one of the male friends).    - **M1's friends within this group** are:      - **Alice** (since everyone is friends with each other).      - **F1 and F2** (the two female friends).      - **M2, M3, and M4** (the other male friends).  4. **Determine how many female friends M1 has**:    - **Female friends**: Alice, F1, and F2.    - **Count**: 3 female friends.  ### Answer: 3",
