        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's reconstruct Alice's family tree step by step:  1. **Alice's Immediate Family**:    - Alice has **2 sisters**, making them **3 siblings** in total.    - There's an implication that there might be another sibling since later information suggests Alice's father has **4 children** (explained below).  2. **Maternal Side**:    - **Alice's mother** has:      - **1 sister** who has **no children**.      - **2 brothers** who together have **6 children** (since Alice's mother has **6 nephews and nieces**).    - Therefore, Alice has **6 maternal cousins**.  3. **Paternal Side**:    - **Alice's father** has:      - **1 brother** who has **2 daughters** (Alice's cousins).      - The same brother has **4 nephews and nieces**.    - Since no other siblings of Alice's father are mentioned, these **4 nephews and nieces** must be the children of Alice's father.    - This implies that **Alice's father has 4 children** (Alice, her **2 sisters**, and **1 brother** we weren't initially told about).  4. **Calculating Total Cousins**:    - **Maternal cousins**: **6**.    - **Paternal cousins**: **2** (the daughters of Alice's father's brother).  **Therefore, Alice's sister has a total of \\(6 + 2 = 8\\) cousins.**  ### Answer: 8",
