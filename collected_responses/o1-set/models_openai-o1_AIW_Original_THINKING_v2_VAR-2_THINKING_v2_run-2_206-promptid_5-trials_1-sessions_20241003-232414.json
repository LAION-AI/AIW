        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's carefully analyze the family structure:  - **Alice has 2 sisters.** Including Alice herself, that makes **3 sisters** in total. - **Alice has 4 brothers.**  So, the total number of siblings in the family is **7** (3 sisters + 4 brothers).  Now, considering **one of Alice's brothers**, we need to determine how many sisters he has:  - Since he is one of the brothers, he cannot be his own brother. - Therefore, he has:   - **3 sisters** (Alice + 2 other sisters)   - **3 brothers** (the other brothers)  Thus, **Alice's brother has 3 sisters**.  ### Answer: 3",

        "model_response":"First, let us carefully analyze the information given:  - Alice has **2 sisters**. - She also has **4 brothers**.  When someone says they have \"2 sisters,\" they are typically not counting themselves. Therefore, the total number of girls in the family is:  - Alice herself - Plus her **2 sisters**  So, there are **3 girls** in total.  Similarly, there are **4 brothers**, making the total number of children in the family:  - **3 girls** (Alice and her 2 sisters) - **4 boys** (her brothers) - **Total = 3 + 4 = 7 children**  Now, we are asked: **\"How many sisters does Alice's brother have?\"**  Alice's brother is one of the 4 boys. Each brother's siblings include:  - **All the sisters**: Alice and her 2 sisters (**3 sisters in total**) - **The other brothers**: The 3 brothers (excluding himself)  But the question specifically asks about **sisters**. Therefore, each brother has **3 sisters**.  ### Answer: 3",
