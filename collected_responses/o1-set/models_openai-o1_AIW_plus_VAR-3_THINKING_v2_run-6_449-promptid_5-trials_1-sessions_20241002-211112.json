        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we need to carefully trace Alice's family relationships step by step.  1. **Alice's Siblings**:    - Alice has 3 sisters, making the total minimum number of children in her immediate family 4 (including Alice).     2. **Alice's Father's Side**:    - Alice's father has one brother, who has one son.    - The father's brother has 5 nephews and nieces, which must be the children of Alice's father because there are no other siblings mentioned.    - This means Alice's father has 5 children (since his brother has 5 nephews and nieces).    - Since we know about Alice and her 3 sisters, there must be **1 additional sibling**, likely a brother, to make up the 5 children.  3. **Alice's Mother's Side**:    - Alice's mother has 1 sister (who has no children) and 2 brothers.    - The sister has 7 nephews and nieces, who are the children of her siblings (since she has no children).    - We already have 5 children from Alice's mother (including the previously deduced brother), so the two brothers must have **2 children in total** (since 7 - 5 = 2).  4. **Calculating Cousins**:    - **Maternal Cousins**: 2 (children of the two maternal uncles).    - **Paternal Cousin**: 1 (the son of the paternal uncle).    - **Total Cousins**: 2 (maternal) + 1 (paternal) = **3 cousins**.  ### Answer: 3",

        "model_response":"To determine the number of cousins Alice's sister has, we need to consider both sides of Alice's family.  **Maternal Side (Alice's Mother's Side):**  - **Alice's Mother has:**   - 1 sister who does not have children.   - 2 brothers.    - **Alice's Mother has 7 nephews and nieces.**   - Since her sister has no children, these 7 nephews and nieces must be the children of her 2 brothers.   - Therefore, the 2 brothers have a total of **7 children**.    - **Cousins on Maternal Side:**   - Alice and her siblings have **7 cousins** from their mother's side.  **Paternal Side (Alice's Father's Side):**  - **Alice's Father has a brother** who:   - Has **1 son**.   - Has **5 nephews and nieces** in total.    - **Understanding the 5 Nephews and Nieces:**   - These are the children of his siblings.   - Since Alice's father has 4 children (Alice and her 3 sisters), there must be another sibling of Alice's father to account for the total of 5 nephews and nieces.    - **Assuming Alice's Father has a Sister (Aunt):**   - This aunt has **1 child** (since 4 children from Alice's father + 1 child from the aunt = 5 nephews and nieces).    - **Cousins on Paternal Side:**   - Alice and her siblings have:     - **1 cousin** (Uncle's son).     - **1 cousin** (Aunt's child).   - Totaling **2 cousins** from their father's side.  **Total Cousins:**  - **Maternal Cousins:** 7 - **Paternal Cousins:** 2 - **Total Cousins:** 7 + 2 = **9**  Therefore, Alice's sister has **9 cousins**.  ### Answer: 9",

Since nephews and nieces come from siblings' children, and only Alice's father is mentioned as a sibling, it means Alice's father has **5 children**. - Alice has 3 sisters, and including herself, that's 4 daughters.
