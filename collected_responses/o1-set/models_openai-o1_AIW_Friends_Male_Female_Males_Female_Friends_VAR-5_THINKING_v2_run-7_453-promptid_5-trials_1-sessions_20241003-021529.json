        "model_response":"Given that Alice has 2 male friends (M1, M2) and 3 female friends (F1, F2, F3), and all her friends are friends with each other and have no other friends, we need to determine how many female friends one male friend (say, M1) has.  Since M1 is friends with everyone else in Alice's circle (which includes M2, F1, F2, and F3), M1 has 3 female friends (F1, F2, F3).  ### Answer: 3",

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:  1. **Identifying the Characters**:     - **Alice**.     - **2 Male Friends**: Let's call them **M1** and **M2**.     - **3 Female Friends**: Let's call them **F1**, **F2**, and **F3**.  2. **Understanding the Relationships**:     - **All of Alice's friends are friends with each other**. This means that every person among M1, M2, F1, F2, and F3 is friends with the others in this group.     - **They have no other friends aside**. This indicates that their entire friendship circle is limited to this group (excluding external friends).  3. **Clarifying Alice's Role**:     - The phrase \"They all are friends with each other\" suggests that **Alice is included** in this mutual friendship group.     - Therefore, the entire group consists of **6 people**: Alice, M1, M2, F1, F2, and F3.     - This forms a **complete friendship network** where **everyone is friends with everyone else**.  4. **Calculating the Number of Female Friends for a Male Friend**:     - Let's consider one male friend, say **M1**.     - **M1's Friends**:         - **Alice** (female)         - **F1** (female)         - **F2** (female)         - **F3** (female)         - **M2** (male)     - **Number of Female Friends**: M1 has **4 female friends** (Alice, F1, F2, and F3).  5. **Conclusion**:     - Therefore, each male friend of Alice has **4 female friends** within this group.  ### Answer: 4",

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's carefully break down the information:  1. **Alice has 2 male friends and 3 female friends.** 2. **All of Alice's friends are friends with each other.** 3. **They have no other friends aside from each other.**  First, note that **\"they\" refers to Alice's friends**, not including Alice herself. This is deduced from the phrasing: Alice has friends, and **they** all are friends with each other. So the group we're focusing on consists of **5 people** (2 males and 3 females), excluding Alice.  Since all of Alice's friends are friends with each other and have no other friends, each person in this group is friends with the other 4 people in the group.  For any one of the **male friends**, his friends within this group are:  - The **other male friend** (1 male) - The **3 female friends** (3 females)  Therefore, each male friend has:  - **Total friends**: 4 - **Female friends**: 3  ### Answer: 3",
