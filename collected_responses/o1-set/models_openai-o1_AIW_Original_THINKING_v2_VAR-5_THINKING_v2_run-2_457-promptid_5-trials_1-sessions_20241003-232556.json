Let's consider one brother.  3. **Brother's Sisters:** The brother's sisters are all the female siblings excluding himself (since he's male). The sisters are:    - Alice    - Sister 1    - Sister 2    - Sister 3  4. **Counting the Sisters:** There are 4 sisters in total that each brother has.  ### Answer: 4",
