        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we need to carefully interpret the given information and determine the number of female friends a male friend of Alice has.  **Given:** - Alice has 3 male friends (let's call them M1, M2, M3). - She also has 6 female friends (F1 to F6). - **They all are friends with each other** and have no other friends aside.  Firstly, the phrase \"They all are friends with each other\" includes all of Alice's friends and Alice herself. This means every person in this group is friends with every other person in the group, forming a complete network of friendships among these 10 people (Alice + 9 friends).  **Now, for a male friend (say M1):** - His friends are:   - Alice (since they are friends and part of the group).   - The other 2 male friends (M2 and M3).   - The 6 female friends (F1 to F6). - This totals **9 friends** for M1.  **Counting the female friends of M1:** - The 6 female friends (F1 to F6). - **Plus Alice**, who is also female and his friend. - So, M1 has **7 female friends**.  ### Answer: 7",
