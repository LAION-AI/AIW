Now, we need to find out **how many brothers Alice has**.  Since Alice and Bob are siblings in the same family:  - The total number of siblings is the sum of brothers and sisters: **2 sisters + 5 brothers = 7 siblings**. - All the brothers in the family are also Alice's brothers.  Therefore, **Alice has 5 brothers**.  ### Answer: 5",
