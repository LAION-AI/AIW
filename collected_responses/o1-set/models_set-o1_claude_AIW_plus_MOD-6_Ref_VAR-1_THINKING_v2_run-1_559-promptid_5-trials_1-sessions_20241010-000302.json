Alice's father's side:    * Alice's father has 2 sisters.    * Alice's father has 1 brother who has 5 nephews and nieces in total, and who also has 2 sons.      - The 5 nephews and nieces of Alice's father's brother include his own 2 sons and Alice, her sister, and her brother.      - This confirms that Alice's father's brother has only 2 children (sons).  Now, let's count the cousins of Alice's sister: * From Alice's mother's side:   - The 3 children of Alice's mother's 2 brothers are cousins of Alice's sister. * From Alice's father's side:   - The 2 sons of Alice's father's brother are cousins of Alice's sister.   - We don't know if Alice's father's 2 sisters have any children, so we can't count any cousins from them.  Therefore, the total number of cousins that Alice's sister has is: * 3 (from Alice's mother's side) * + 2 (from Alice's father's side) * = 5 cousins in total.

Given: - Alice has 1 sister and 1 brother. - Alice's mother has 2 brothers. - Alice's mother has 1 sister who does not have children and has 6 nephews and nieces in total. - Alice's father has 2 sisters. - Alice's father has a brother who has 5 nephews and nieces in total and 2 sons.  Step 1: Determine the number of cousins from Alice's mother's side. - Alice's mother has 2 brothers, so their children will be Alice's cousins. - The total number of nephews and nieces of Alice's mother's sister is 6, which includes Alice, her sister, and her brother. - So, the number of cousins from Alice's mother's brothers is: 6 - 3 = 3 cousins.  Step 2: Determine the number of cousins from Alice's father's side. - Alice's father has 2 sisters, so their children will be Alice's cousins. - Alice's father's brother has 2 sons, who are also Alice's cousins. - The total number of nephews and nieces of Alice's father's brother is 5, which includes his own 2 sons. - So, the number of cousins from Alice's father's sisters is: 5 - 2 = 3 cousins.  Step 3: Calculate the total number of cousins Alice's sister has. - Alice's sister has the same number of cousins as Alice. - Total number of cousins = Cousins from mother's side + Cousins from father's side - Total number of cousins = 3 + 3 = 6 cousins  Double-checking the solution: - The given information is consistent, and the steps followed are logical. - The total number of cousins (6) matches the sum of cousins from Alice's mother's side (3) and father's side (3).

        "model_response":"Let's think through this step-by-step:  1. Alice has 1 sister and 1 brother. This means Alice's parents have 3 children in total.  2. Alice's mother has:    - 2 brothers    - 1 sister (who has no children)  3. Alice's father has:    - 2 sisters    - 1 brother (who has 2 sons)  4. We need to count the children of Alice's aunts and uncles, excluding Alice and her siblings:     From mother's side:    - Mother's brothers: We don't know how many children they have.    - Mother's sister: Has no children.     From father's side:    - Father's sisters: We don't know how many children they have.    - Father's brother: Has 2 sons.  5. We're told that Alice's mother's sister (who has no children) has 6 nephews and nieces in total. These 6 include:    - Alice and her 2 siblings (3)    - The children of Alice's mother's 2 brothers (unknown number, let's call it x)    So: 3 + x = 6    x = 3  6. We're also told that Alice's father's brother (who has 2 sons) has 5 nephews and nieces in total. These 5 include:    - Alice and her 2 siblings (3)    - The children of Alice's father's 2 sisters (unknown number, let's call it y)    So: 3 + y = 5    y = 2  7. Now we can count Alice's cousins:    - From mother's side: 3 (children of mother's 2 brothers)    - From father's side: 2 (children of father's 2 sisters) + 2 (sons of father's brother) = 4  8.

        "model_response":"Let's think through this step-by-step:  1. First, let's identify Alice's siblings:    - Alice has 1 sister and 1 brother  2. Now, let's look at Alice's mother's side:    - Mother has 2 brothers    - Mother has 1 sister (Alice's aunt) who has no children    - This aunt has 6 nephews and nieces in total  3. On Alice's father's side:    - Father has 2 sisters    - Father has 1 brother    - This uncle has 2 sons    - This uncle has 5 nephews and nieces in total  4. To find Alice's sister's cousins, we need to count the children of Alice's aunts and uncles:    - Mother's side: 2 uncles, but we don't know how many children they have    - Father's side: 2 aunts (children unknown) and 1 uncle with 2 sons  5. We know Alice's uncle on her father's side has 5 nephews and nieces:    - These would be Alice, her sister, her brother, and the 2 sons of the uncle    - This adds up correctly: 3 (Alice and her siblings) + 2 (uncle's sons) = 5  6. We can deduce that Alice's aunts on her father's side don't have children, as they're not needed to reach the total of 5 nephews and nieces  7. On the mother's side, we know the aunt has 6 nephews and nieces:    - 3 of these are Alice and her siblings    - The other 3 must be children of the mother's 2 brothers  8. So, the cousins of Alice's sister are:    - 3 from mother's side (children of mother's brothers)    - 2 from father's side (children of father's brother)  9.

We need to count the children of Alice's aunts and uncles, excluding Alice and her siblings.  5. From the mother's side:    - The mother's sister has no children    - We don't know if the mother's brothers have children  6. From the father's side:    - We know the father's brother has 2 sons    - We don't know if the father's sisters have children  7. The key information is that the father's brother has 5 nephews and nieces in total:    - We know 3 of these are Alice and her siblings    - This means the father's sisters must have 2 children in total (5 - 3 = 2)  8. So, the total number of cousins is:    - 2 (father's brother's sons) + 2 (father's sisters' children) = 4  9. Double-checking:     - This matches with the information that the mother's sister (who has no children) has 6 nephews and nieces:       3 (Alice and her siblings) + 2 (father's brother's sons) + 1 (the other child of father's sisters) = 6  Therefore, Alice's sister has 4 cousins.  ### Answer: 4",

From the father's side:    - We know the father's brother has 2 sons.    - We don't know if the father's sisters have children.  7. The tricky part is that we're given information about nephews and nieces:    - The mother's sister has 6 nephews and nieces in total.    - The father's brother has 5 nephews and nieces in total.  8. The 6 nephews and nieces of the mother's sister include Alice and her 2 siblings (3 total), plus 3 others who must be the children of the mother's brothers.  9. The 5 nephews and nieces of the father's brother include Alice and her 2 siblings (3 total), plus 2 others who must be the children of the father's sisters.  10.
