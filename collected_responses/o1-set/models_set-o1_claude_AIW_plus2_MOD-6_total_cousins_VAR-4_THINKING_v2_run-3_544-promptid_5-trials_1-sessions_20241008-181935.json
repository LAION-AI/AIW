Alice's mother has 2 brothers. The children of these brothers are Alice's cousins and her sister's cousins. However, we don't know how many children they have.  3. Alice's mother also has 1 sister who does not have children. This sister has 4 nephews and 2 nieces in total. These nephews and nieces are the children of Alice's mother's brothers (from step 2). So, Alice and her sister have 4 male cousins and 2 female cousins from their mother's side.  4. Alice's father has 2 sisters. The children of these sisters are also Alice's cousins and her sister's cousins. However, we don't know how many children they have.  5. Alice's father also has a brother who has 3 nephews and 2 nieces in total. This brother also has 1 daughter. The 3 nephews and 2 nieces are the children of Alice's father's sisters (from step 4), and they are Alice's cousins and her sister's cousins.
