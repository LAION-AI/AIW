        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we'll construct Alice's family tree step by step.  **Alice's Immediate Family:** - Alice has **2 sisters**, so there are **3 daughters** in Alice's family.  **Maternal Side:** - **Alice's mother** has:   - **1 sister** who **does not have children** (childless).   - **2 brothers**.  - The childless sister has **6 nephews and nieces**. These are the children of her siblings (since she doesn't have children herself). So:   - From Alice's mother: **3 nieces** (Alice and her 2 sisters).   - Therefore, the **2 brothers** must have **3 children in total** (since 6 total nephews and nieces minus the 3 from Alice's mother equals 3).  - So on the maternal side, Alice's sister has **3 cousins** from her uncles.  **Paternal Side:** - **Alice's father** has a **brother** who:   - Has **2 daughters** (Alice's cousins).   - Has **4 nephews and nieces**. These are the children of his siblings.  - Since Alice's father's brother has **4 nephews and nieces**, and Alice's father has **3 daughters** (Alice and her 2 sisters), there's **1 nephew or niece unaccounted for**. This implies that Alice's father must have another sibling (likely a sister) who has **1 child**.  - So on the paternal side, Alice's sister has **2 cousins** from her uncle and **1 cousin** from the additional aunt, totaling **3 cousins**.  **Total Cousins:** - Maternal cousins: **3**. - Paternal cousins: **3**. - **Total cousins:** \\( 3 + 3 = 6 \\).  **Answer: 6**",

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we'll carefully reconstruct Alice's family tree based on the information provided.  1. **Alice's Immediate Family:**    - **Parents:** Mother and Father.    - **Siblings:** Alice has 2 sisters (Sister 1 and Sister 2). The problem suggests that Alice's father has 4 children (since his brother has 4 nephews and nieces), so Alice must also have a brother. Therefore, Alice's immediate family consists of 4 children: Alice, her 2 sisters, and a brother.  2. **Mother's Side of the Family:**    - **Mother's Siblings:**       - **Sister (Aunt A):** She has no children and has 6 nephews and nieces (the children of her siblings).      - **Brother 1 (Uncle B):**      - **Brother 2 (Uncle C):**    - **Counting the Nephews and Nieces:**      - **From Mother:** 4 children (Alice, her 2 sisters, and her brother).      - **From Uncles (Uncles B and C):** Since Aunt A has a total of 6 nephews and nieces, and 4 are from Mother, the remaining 2 must be from Uncles B and C. Therefore, Uncles B and C have 2 children collectively.    - **Maternal Cousins:** Alice and her siblings have **2 cousins** on their mother's side.  3. **Father's Side of the Family:**    - **Father's Sibling:**      - **Brother (Uncle D):** He has 2 daughters and 4 nephews and nieces (the children of his siblings).    - **Counting the Nephews and Nieces:**      - Since Uncle D has 4 nephews and nieces, and if Alice's father is his only sibling, then these are Alice and her 3 siblings.    - **Paternal Cousins:** Alice and her siblings have **2 cousins** (Uncle D's daughters) on their father's side.  4. **Total Cousins:**    - **Maternal Cousins:** 2    - **Paternal Cousins:** 2    - **Total Cousins:** \\( 2 + 2 = 4 \\)  But we must consider that the problem mentions the sister of Alice's mother has 6 nephews and nieces, and the father\u2019s brother has 4 nephews and nieces, implying there might be an extra cousin we initially missed.  Upon reevaluation, considering the \"6 nephews and nieces\" on the mother's side and \"4 nephews and nieces\" on the father's side, and the distribution of children among their siblings, we correctly deduce that:  **Alice's sister has 5 cousins.**  ### Answer: 5",

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's break down the family relationships step by step.  **Maternal Side:**  1. **Alice's Mother** has:    - 1 sister (Alice's maternal aunt) who **does not have children**.    - 2 brothers (Alice's maternal uncles).  2. The childless sister has **6 nephews and nieces**. These are the children of her siblings (since she has no children of her own):    - **Total children of Alice's mother and her two brothers = 6**.  3. We know that Alice has **2 sisters**, but the problem doesn't state that she has **only** 2 sisters. She could have more siblings.  4. Since Alice and her sisters are among the 6 nephews and nieces, let's consider two scenarios:    - **Scenario A**: Alice has **no other siblings** (only 2 sisters). So, Alice's mother has **3 children**.      - This means the two uncles have **3 children in total** (since \\(6 \\text{ nephews and nieces} - 3 \\text{ from Alice's mother} = 3 \\text{ from uncles}\\)).    - **Scenario B**: Alice has **1 brother** in addition to her 2 sisters. So, Alice's mother has **4 children**.      - This means the two uncles have **2 children in total** (since \\(6 - 4 = 2\\)).  **Paternal Side:**  1. **Alice's Father** has:    - 1 brother (Alice's paternal uncle) who has **2 daughters**.    - This uncle has **4 nephews and nieces**, who are the children of his siblings.  2. Since only Alice's father is mentioned as his sibling, it's implied that the **4 nephews and nieces** are Alice and her siblings.  3. Therefore, **Alice's father must have 4 children** for his brother to have 4 nephews and nieces. This suggests that Alice has **1 brother** in addition to her 2 sisters.  **Conclusion:**  - Combining both sides, it's most consistent to assume that **Alice has 1 brother and 2 sisters**. - **Total cousins on the maternal side**: The uncles have either **2 or 3 children** (from scenarios A and B). - **Total cousins on the paternal side**: The paternal uncle has **2 daughters**.  Based on the information and the logical deductions:  **Number of Cousins Alice's Sister Has = 5**  ### Answer: 5",
