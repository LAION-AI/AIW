        "model_response":"Let's break down the problem step by step to ensure accuracy:  1. **Alice's Friends:**    - Alice has 2 female friends.    - Alice has 4 male friends.    - Total friends: 2 (female) + 4 (male) = 6 friends.  2. **Mutual Friendships:**    - All of Alice's friends are friends with each other.    - This means each person is friends with every other person in this group of 6 friends, and there are no external friends.  3. **Understanding a Male Friend of Alice:**    - Consider one of Alice's male friends.    - This male friend is friends with:      - Alice (assuming Alice is female based on the context).      - The other 3 male friends.      - The 2 female friends.  4. **Counting Female Friends of a Male Friend:**    - Female friends in the group:      - Alice herself.      - The other 2 female friends.    - Total female friends for any male friend: 1 (Alice) + 2 = 3.  Therefore, each male friend of Alice has **3 female friends**.  ### Answer: 3",
