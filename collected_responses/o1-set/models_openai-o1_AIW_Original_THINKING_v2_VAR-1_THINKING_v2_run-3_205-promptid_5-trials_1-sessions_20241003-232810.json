        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:  1. **Total Number of Sisters**: Alice has 6 sisters *in addition to herself*. So, including Alice, there are a total of 7 sisters.  2. **Total Number of Brothers**: Alice has 3 brothers.  3. **Total Number of Siblings**: Combining the sisters and brothers gives us a total of 10 siblings (7 sisters + 3 brothers).  4. **Siblings of Alice's Brother**: One of Alice's brothers would have all the other siblings except himself. So, he has 9 siblings (since he can't be his own sibling).  5. **Number of Sisters for Alice's Brother**: The brother's sisters would be all the female siblings. Since there are 7 sisters in total (including Alice), the brother has 7 sisters.  ### Answer: 7",
