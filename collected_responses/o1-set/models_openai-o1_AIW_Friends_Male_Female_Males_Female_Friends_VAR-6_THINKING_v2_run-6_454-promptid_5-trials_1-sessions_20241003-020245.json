        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's carefully analyze the information provided:  - Alice has **5 female friends** and **3 male friends**. - **They all are friends with each other** and have **no other friends aside**.  The key here is understanding who \"They\" refers to. Since \"They all are friends with each other\" follows after mentioning Alice's friends, \"They\" includes **Alice and all her friends**. Therefore, the group consists of:  - **Alice** - **5 female friends (F1, F2, F3, F4, F5)** - **3 male friends (M1, M2, M3)**  This makes a total of **9 people**, and the network is fully connected, meaning everyone is friends with everyone else in this group.  Now, focusing on one of the male friends (let's say M1), his friends within this group are:  - **Alice (female)** - **5 female friends (F1-F5)** - **2 male friends (M2, M3)**  Therefore, M1 has a total of **8 friends** in this group.  To find out how many **female friends** M1 has:  - **Alice** (female) - **5 female friends** (F1-F5)  So, M1 has **6 female friends** in total.  ### Answer: 6",
