Alice has 2 sisters, which means there are 2 sisters in addition to herself, totaling 3 girls. Similarly, Bob has 2 brothers, meaning there are 2 brothers in addition to himself, totaling 3 boys.  To find out how many brothers Alice has, we consider all her male siblings. Since there are 3 boys in the family (Bob and his 2 brothers), Alice has 3 brothers.  ### Answer: 3",

So, there are **3 sisters** in total: Alice, Sister 1, and Sister 2.  3. **Bob has 2 brothers.** Similarly, Bob doesn't count himself as his own brother, so there are 2 other brothers besides Bob.
