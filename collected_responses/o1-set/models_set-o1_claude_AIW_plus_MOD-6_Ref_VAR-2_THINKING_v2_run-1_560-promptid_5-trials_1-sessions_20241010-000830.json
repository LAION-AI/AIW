Alice's father's side:    - 2 sisters (Alice's aunts)    - 1 brother (Alice's uncle) who has 1 son    This uncle has 4 nephews and nieces in total, which again matches the 4 children in Alice's family.  4. Counting Alice's cousins:    - From mother's side:       * 2 uncles, but we don't know if they have children    - From father's side:      * 2 aunts, but we don't know if they have children      * 1 uncle who has 1 son  5. The only cousin we can confirm with certainty is the 1 son of Alice's paternal uncle.  6. Since the question asks about Alice's sister's cousins, the answer would be the same as Alice's cousins.  Double-checking: - We don't have enough information about potential children from Alice's other aunts and uncles. - The information about nephews and nieces helps confirm Alice's immediate family size but doesn't provide additional information about cousins. - The only cousin we can confirm is the 1 son from Alice's paternal uncle.

On Alice's father's side:    - Her father has 2 sisters    - Her father has 1 brother who has 1 son  4. To find Alice's sister's cousins, we need to count the children of Alice's aunts and uncles, excluding Alice and her siblings.  5. From the mother's side:    - We know Alice's mother's sister has 6 nephews and nieces in total    - This includes Alice and her 3 siblings (4 in total)    - So, Alice's mother's brothers must have 2 children in total (6 - 4 = 2)  6. From the father's side:    - We know Alice's father's brother has 4 nephews and nieces in total    - This includes Alice and her 3 siblings (4 in total)    - We also know this uncle has 1 son    - Alice's father's sisters don't seem to have any children, as the total matches Alice and her siblings  7.

We can use the information about nephews and nieces to deduce more:    - Mother's sister has 6 nephews and nieces:       These are Alice, her 2 sisters, and her brother (4 total), plus 2 more    - Father's brother has 4 nephews and nieces:      These are Alice, her 2 sisters, and her brother (4 total)  6. From this, we can conclude:    - On mother's side: The 2 uncles have 2 children in total    - On father's side: The 2 aunts have no children (as the uncle's 4 nephews\/nieces are accounted for by Alice and her siblings)  7. So, Alice's sister's cousins are:    - 2 from mother's side (children of mother's brothers)    - 1 from father's side (son of father's brother)  8.

This means the other siblings (including Alice) have a combined total of 6 children.  3. **Mother's Side:**    - Alice's mother has 2 brothers (Uncle M1 and Uncle M2). However, there is no information provided about their children, so we assume they have no children contributing to the cousins.  4. **Father's Side:**    - Alice's father has 2 sisters (Aunt F1 and Aunt F2) and 1 brother (Uncle F3).    - Uncle F3 has 1 son, meaning he has 1 child who is Alice's cousin.  5. **Total Cousins:**    - From the mother's side: 0 cousins (since no children are mentioned).    - From the father's side: 1 cousin (the son of Uncle F3).

These nephews and nieces are the children of the other siblings (since she herself has no children).  2. **Parents' Siblings (Uncles and Aunts):**    - **Mother's Side:** Alice's mother has 2 brothers.
