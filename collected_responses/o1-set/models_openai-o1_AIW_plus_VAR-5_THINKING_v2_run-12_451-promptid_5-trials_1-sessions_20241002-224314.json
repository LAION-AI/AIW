        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's carefully reconstruct Alice's family and determine the number of her cousins.  **First**, Alice has **3 sisters**. So, there are **4 daughters** in Alice's immediate family (including herself).  **Mother's side:**  - Alice's mother has **1 sister** (who has no children) and **2 brothers**. - The aunt with no children has **6 nephews and nieces**.   - Since she has no children, these nephews and nieces must be the children of her siblings.   - Alice and her 3 sisters account for **4** of these nephews and nieces (children of the mother).   - The remaining **2 nephews\/nieces** must be the children of the mother's **2 brothers**. - Therefore, Alice has **2 cousins** on her mother's side (children of her maternal uncles).  **Father's side:**  - Alice's father has a **brother** who has **1 son**. - This brother (uncle) has **5 nephews and nieces** in total.   - These are the children of his siblings.   - Alice and her 3 sisters are **4** of these nephews and nieces (children of the father).   - The remaining **1 nephew\/niece** must be the child of another sibling (implying Alice's father has at least one more sibling). - Therefore, Alice has **1 cousin** from her father's brother (uncle's son) and **1 cousin** from the other sibling.  **Total cousins:**  - **2 cousins** from her mother's side. - **2 cousins** from her father's side. - **Total**: **4 cousins**.  ### Answer: 4",

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's break down the family relationships and count step by step:  1. **Alice's Immediate Family:**    - Alice has **3 sisters**.    - Alice's father and mother are her parents.    - It's implied that Alice also has a brother (since her father's brother has 5 nephews and nieces, and we can account for only 4 nieces from the sisters).  2. **Maternal Side (Mother's Family):**    - Alice's mother has **1 sister** (who has **no children**).    - She also has **2 brothers** (Uncle1 and Uncle2).    - The sister (Alice's aunt) has **6 nephews and nieces** in total:      - From Alice's mother: **4 children** (Alice and her 3 sisters).      - Therefore, the **2 brothers must have 2 children** between them (since 6 - 4 = 2).    - So, from her mother's side, Alice's sister has **2 cousins** (children of Uncle1 and Uncle2).  3. **Paternal Side (Father's Family):**    - Alice's father has **1 brother** (Uncle F).    - Uncle F has **5 nephews and nieces**:      - From Alice's father: **5 children** (Alice, her 3 sisters, and a brother).    - Uncle F also has **1 son**.    - So, from her father's side, Alice's sister has **1 cousin** (Uncle F's son).  4. **Total Cousins:**    - Maternal cousins: **2**    - Paternal cousins: **1**    - **Total cousins = 2 + 1 = 3**  ### Answer: 3",

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we'll determine the number of cousins Alice's sister has by analyzing her relatives step by step.  **Alice and Her Siblings:** - Alice has 3 sisters. So, there are 4 daughters in Alice's immediate family (including Alice herself).  **Mother's Side:** - Alice's mother has a sister who doesn't have children. - This sister has 6 nephews and nieces. Since she doesn't have her own children, these must be her siblings' children. - Alice's mother also has 2 brothers. - Therefore, the total siblings in Alice's mother's family are:   - Alice's mother   - 1 sister (childless)   - 2 brothers - The 6 nephews and nieces are the children of:   - Alice's mother (4 daughters)   - 2 brothers (must have 2 children in total to make up the 6 nieces and nephews) - So, from her mother's side, Alice's sister has **2 cousins** (children of her maternal uncles).  **Father's Side:** - Alice's father has a brother (Alice's uncle) who has:   - 1 son   - 5 nephews and nieces - The uncle's nephews and nieces are his siblings' children. - Since only Alice's father is mentioned as his sibling, and Alice's parents have 4 daughters, there must be an additional sibling or child to account for 5 nephews and nieces. - It's logical to infer that Alice also has a brother, making the total children in her family 5 (4 sisters + 1 brother). - So, from her father's side, Alice's sister has **1 cousin** (the son of her paternal uncle).  **Total Cousins:** - Mother's side: 2 cousins - Father's side: 1 cousin - **Total cousins: 2 + 1 = 3**  ### Answer: 3",
