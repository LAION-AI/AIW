Alice's father's side:    - Alice's father has 2 sisters.    - Alice's father has 1 brother.    - The brother has 5 nephews and nieces in total and 1 daughter.

Cousins from Alice's mother's side:    - Alice's mother's brothers have 6 children in total (nephews and nieces).    - These 6 children are cousins to Alice and her siblings.  2. Cousins from Alice's father's side:    - Alice's father's brother has 1 daughter.    - This daughter is a cousin to Alice and her siblings.    - Alice's father's sisters do not have any children mentioned in the problem.  3.

Double-checking the solution: - The information about Alice's mother's sister having 6 nephews and nieces matches the number of cousins from Alice's mother's side. - The information about Alice's father's brother having 1 daughter matches the number of cousins from Alice's father's side. - The calculation for the total number of cousins is correct.  ### Answer: Alice's sister has 7 cousins.",

        "model_response":"Let's think through this step by step:  1. First, let's identify Alice's immediate family:    - Alice has 1 sister and 1 brother    - So Alice's parents have 3 children in total  2. Now, let's look at Alice's mother's side:    - Alice's mother has 2 brothers    - Alice's mother has 1 sister who has no children    - The sister has 6 nephews and nieces in total  3. On Alice's father's side:    - Alice's father has 2 sisters    - Alice's father has 1 brother    - This brother has 5 nephews and nieces in total    - This brother also has 1 daughter  4. To find Alice's cousins, we need to count the children of Alice's aunts and uncles:    - On mother's side:       * 2 uncles, but we don't know how many children they have    - On father's side:      * 2 aunts, but we don't know how many children they have      * 1 uncle who has 1 daughter  5. The only definite information we have about cousins is the 1 daughter of Alice's paternal uncle.  6. We might be tempted to use the information about nephews and nieces, but this is a trap:    - The 6 nephews and nieces of Alice's maternal aunt include Alice and her siblings    - The 5 nephews and nieces of Alice's paternal uncle also include Alice and her siblings  7. Therefore, we can only be certain about 1 cousin - the daughter of Alice's paternal uncle.  8. Alice's sister would have the same number of cousins as Alice.  After careful consideration, we can only definitively conclude that Alice's sister has 1 cousin.  ### Answer: 1",

Alice's father's side:    - Her father has 2 sisters    - Her father has 1 brother who has 5 nephews and nieces and 1 daughter  4. To find Alice's sister's cousins, we need to count the children of Alice's aunts and uncles:     Mother's side:    - 2 uncles: We don't know how many children they have    - 1 aunt: No children     Father's side:    - 2 aunts: We don't know how many children they have    - 1 uncle: We know he has 1 daughter  5. The key information is:    - Alice's mother's sister (aunt) has 6 nephews and nieces    - Alice's father's brother (uncle) has 5 nephews and nieces  6. Since we know Alice's parents have 3 children:    - On mother's side: 6 nephews and nieces - 3 (Alice and her siblings) = 3 cousins    - On father's side: 5 nephews and nieces - 3 (Alice and her siblings) = 2 cousins  7. Total cousins: 3 + 2 = 5  8. Double-checking: This matches with the information that Alice's father's brother has 1 daughter, which is one of these cousins.  Therefore, Alice's sister has 5 cousins.  ### Answer: 5",

This includes:    - Alice    - Alice's sister    - Alice's brother    - The uncle's daughter from father's side    That's 4 accounted for, meaning there must be 2 more cousins from mother's side uncles.  4. We're also told that Alice's father's brother (uncle) has 5 nephews and nieces in total. This includes:    - Alice    - Alice's sister    - Alice's brother    - The 2 cousins from mother's side (as calculated above)    That's all 5 accounted for, meaning there are no additional cousins from father's side aunts.  5.
