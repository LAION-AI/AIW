So, she has **6 siblings** (7 total children - 1 herself).    - We know she has **1 sister**.    - Therefore, the number of brothers Alice has is:      \\[      \\text{Number of brothers} = \\text{Total siblings} - \\text{Number of sisters} = 6 - 1 = 5      \\]     **Answer**: Alice has **5 brothers**.  ### Answer: Alice has 5 brothers.",
