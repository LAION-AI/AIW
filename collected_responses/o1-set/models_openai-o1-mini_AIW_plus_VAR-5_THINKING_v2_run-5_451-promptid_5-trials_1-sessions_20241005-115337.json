Given that Alice and her 3 sisters make up 4 of these, it implies there is **1 additional cousin** from another sibling (assuming the father has more than one brother, but only one has children).    - **Cousins from Father's Side:** This accounts for **1** additional cousin.  4. **Total Cousins:**    - **From Mother's Side:** 6 cousins.    - **From Father's Side:** 1 cousin.    - **Total:** **6 + 1 = 7** cousins.
