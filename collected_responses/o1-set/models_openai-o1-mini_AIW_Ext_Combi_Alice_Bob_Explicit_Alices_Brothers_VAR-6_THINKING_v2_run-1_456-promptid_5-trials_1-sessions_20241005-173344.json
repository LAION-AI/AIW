This typically means **3 sisters apart from herself**, totaling **4 female siblings** (including Alice).  3. **Brothers:**    - Bob has **5 brothers**. This usually refers to **5 brothers in addition to Bob himself**, totaling **6 male siblings**.  4. **Alice's Brothers:**    - Since Alice is female, all her brothers are the male siblings in the family.    - From Bob's perspective, there are **5 brothers** besides himself.    - Therefore, **Alice has 5 brothers**.  ### Answer: 5",
