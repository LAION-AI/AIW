        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's carefully deduce the family composition step by step.  1. **Alice and Bob are siblings** (sister and brother). This means they share the same parents.  2. **Alice has 3 sisters**. Since Alice herself is one sister, having 3 sisters means there are **4 girls in total** in the family.  3. **Bob has 6 brothers**. Including Bob himself, this means there are **7 boys in total** in the family.  4. **Total number of children** in the family is the sum of the total girls and total boys:    - Total children = 4 (girls) + 7 (boys) = **11 children**.  5. **Alice's brothers** are all the boys in the family, which includes Bob and his 6 brothers.    - Therefore, Alice has **7 brothers**.  ### Answer: 7",
