First, let's identify Alice's immediate family:    - Alice has 1 sister and 1 brother    - So, Alice's parents have 3 children in total  2. Now, let's look at Alice's mother's side:    - Alice's mother has 2 brothers    - Alice's mother has 1 sister (who doesn't have children)    - The sister has 6 nephews and nieces in total  3. Alice's father's side:    - Alice's father has 2 sisters    - Alice's father has 1 brother    - This brother has 5 nephews and nieces in total    - This brother has 2 sons  4. To find Alice's sister's cousins, we need to count the children of Alice's aunts and uncles:     From mother's side:    - 2 uncles: We don't know how many children they have     From father's side:    - 2 aunts: We don't know how many children they have    - 1 uncle: We know he has 2 sons  5. The only definite information we have about cousins is the 2 sons of Alice's paternal uncle.  6. We might be tempted to use the information about nephews and nieces, but this could lead to errors:    - The 6 nephews and nieces of Alice's maternal aunt include Alice and her siblings    - The 5 nephews and nieces of Alice's paternal uncle also include Alice and her siblings  7. Therefore, we can only be certain about the 2 cousins from Alice's paternal uncle.  After careful consideration, we can only definitively count 2 cousins.  ### Answer: 2",
