        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we'll need to carefully construct Alice's family tree step by step:  **Maternal Side:**  - **Alice's Mother** has:   - **1 Sister (Aunt M1)** who:     - Has no children.     - Has **6 nephews and nieces**.     - Has **2 brothers** (Uncle M1 and Uncle M2).  Since Aunt M1 has 6 nephews and nieces, these are the children of her siblings (Alice's mother, Uncle M1, and Uncle M2).  We know: - Alice's mother has at least **3 children** (Alice and her 2 sisters). - Let's deduce that Alice's mother actually has **5 children** (we'll see why in the paternal side). - Therefore, Uncle M1 and Uncle M2 together have **1 child** (since 6 nephews and nieces - 5 children of Alice's mother = 1 child).  So, on the maternal side, Alice has **1 cousin** (the child of one of her maternal uncles).  **Paternal Side:**  - **Alice's Father** has:   - **1 Brother (Uncle F1)** who:     - Has **2 daughters** (Alice's cousins).     - Has **5 nephews and nieces**.  Uncle F1's nephews and nieces are the children of his siblings. Since Uncle F1 has only one sibling (Alice's father), and he has 5 nephews and nieces, Alice's father must have **5 children**.  We previously knew Alice has 2 sisters, so Alice must also have **2 brothers** (since 5 - 3 daughters = 2 sons).  So, on the paternal side, Alice has **2 cousins** (the daughters of Uncle F1).  **Total Cousins:**  - Alice's sister's cousins are the same as Alice's cousins. - Total cousins = **1 (maternal side) + 2 (paternal side) = 3 cousins**.  ### Answer: 3",

Therefore, Alice must also have **2 brothers**.    - So, Alice's siblings are herself, **2 sisters**, and **2 brothers**.  2. **Maternal Side:**    - Alice's mother has:      - **1 sister** (who has no children) and **2 brothers**.    - This sister (Alice\u2019s aunt) has **6 nephews and nieces** in total.    - Since Alice's mother has **5 children**, and the two brothers have **1 child** altogether (to make up the total of 6 nephews and nieces), Alice has **1 cousin** on her mother's side.  3. **Paternal Side:**    - Alice's father has **1 brother**, who has **2 daughters** (Alice's cousins).    - This brother (Alice\u2019s uncle) has **5 nephews and nieces** (Alice and her 4 siblings).  4. **Total Cousins:**    - Alice has **2 cousins** on her father's side and **1 cousin** on her mother's side.    - Therefore, **Alice's sister has 3 cousins** in total (since they share the same cousins).  ### Answer: 3",

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cousins Alice's sister has, which equals the total number of children of Alice's aunts and uncles.  Let's break down the family relationships step by step:  **Maternal Side:**  1. Alice's mother has three siblings:    - One **sister** who has **no children**.    - Two **brothers** (Brother1 and Brother2).  2. Alice's mother's sister has **6 nephews and nieces**, who are the children of her siblings (Alice's mother and her two brothers).  3. Alice's mother has **3 daughters** (Alice and her two sisters). Therefore, the combined children of Brother1 and Brother2 must be:    \\( \\text{Total nephews and nieces} - \\text{Mother's children} = 6 - 3 = 3 \\).  4. So, the two maternal uncles have a total of **3 children** between them.  **Paternal Side:**  1. Alice's father has a **brother** who has:    - **2 daughters** (Alice's cousins).    - **5 nephews and nieces**, who are the children of his siblings.  2. Alice's father's brother's nephews and nieces include the children of Alice's father.  3. Since he has **5 nephews and nieces**, Alice's father must have **5 children**.  4. We know Alice has **2 sisters**, and since the father's children total **5**, Alice must also have **2 brothers**.  **Calculating Cousins for Alice's Sister:**  - From the **maternal side**, there are **3 cousins** (children of Brother1 and Brother2). - From the **paternal side**, there are **2 cousins** (the uncle's daughters). - **Total cousins**: \\( 3 + 2 = 5 \\).  ### Answer: 5",
