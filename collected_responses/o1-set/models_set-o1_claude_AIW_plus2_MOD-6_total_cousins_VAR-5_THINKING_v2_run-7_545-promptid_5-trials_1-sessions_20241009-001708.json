Alice's father's side:    - 2 sisters    - 1 brother    The brother has 1 nephew and 4 nieces, which matches Alice and her siblings (3 girls, 1 boy).    This brother also has 1 son.  4. Counting Alice's cousins:    - From mother's side: 2 uncles, but we don't know if they have children or how many.    - From father's side: 2 aunts (we don't know if they have children) and 1 uncle with 1 son.  5. The only cousin we can confirm is the 1 son of Alice's father's brother.  6. Since the question asks about Alice's sister's cousins, and Alice and her siblings would have the same cousins, the answer remains the same.  Double-checking: - We've accounted for all mentioned family members. - We've only included confirmed cousins in our count. - We've verified that Alice's sister would have the same cousins as Alice.  ### Answer: 1",

Cousins come from aunts and uncles, so we need to focus on Alice's parents' siblings.  3. From Alice's mother's side:    - Her mother has 2 brothers    - Her mother has 1 sister, but this sister doesn't have children  4. From Alice's father's side:    - Her father has 2 sisters    - Her father has 1 brother, who has 1 son  5. Now, let's count the cousins:    - Mother's side: We don't know if the 2 brothers have children, so we can't count any cousins from this side.    - Father's side: We know his brother has 1 son, so that's 1 cousin.  6. Double-checking:    - We're not given information about children of Alice's father's sisters or mother's brothers.    - The information about nieces and nephews doesn't help us determine Alice's cousins.  7.

Now, let's look at Alice's mother's side:    - Mother has 2 brothers    - Mother has 1 sister (who doesn't have children)    The sister has 2 nephews and 4 nieces, which matches the number of Alice and her siblings (3) plus Alice's cousins from her mother's brothers.  3. On Alice's father's side:    - Father has 2 sisters    - Father has 1 brother    The brother has 1 nephew and 4 nieces, which doesn't match Alice and her siblings. This suggests that some of these are from the other sister.  4. Alice's father's brother has 1 son. This son is Alice's cousin.  5. To find the total number of cousins:    - From mother's side: 2 brothers, let's assume each has 1 child = 2 cousins    - From father's side: 1 confirmed cousin (the son of father's brother)      Plus, we know father's siblings have more children to account for the 1 nephew and 4 nieces mentioned.  6. The total of Alice's cousins should be:    2 (from mother's side) + 1 (confirmed from father's side) + 3 (to make up the nephew\/niece count) = 6 cousins  7. Double-checking:     - This matches with the information about Alice's aunt (mother's sister) having 2 nephews and 4 nieces (Alice, her 2 sisters, and 1 brother, plus 2 cousins).    - It also matches with Alice's uncle (father's brother) having 1 nephew and 4 nieces (Alice's brother, Alice and her 2 sisters, plus 1 cousin).  Therefore, Alice has 6 cousins, and so does her sister.  ### Answer: 6",

Step 2: Determine the number of cousins from Alice's father's side. - Alice's father has 2 sisters, but we don't know how many children they have. - Alice's father's brother has 1 son, who is Alice's cousin.
