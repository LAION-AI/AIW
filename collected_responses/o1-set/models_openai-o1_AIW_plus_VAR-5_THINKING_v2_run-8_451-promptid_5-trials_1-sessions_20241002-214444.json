        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of cousins that Alice's sister has, which essentially is the number of children born to Alice's aunts and uncles.  **On Alice's Mother's Side:**  1. **Siblings of Alice's Mother:**    - Alice's mother has 1 sister (who has no children) and 2 brothers.  2. **Nephews and Nieces of the Childless Aunt:**    - The childless aunt has 6 nephews and nieces.    - The nephews and nieces would be the children of her siblings.  3. **Children of Alice's Mother and Her Brothers:**    - Alice's mother has 4 daughters (Alice and her 3 sisters).    - This means the 2 brothers together have 2 children (since 6 total nephews and nieces minus the 4 from Alice's mother equals 2).  **On Alice's Father's Side:**  1. **Siblings of Alice's Father:**    - Alice's father has a brother who has 1 son.    - The brother has 5 nephews and nieces.  2. **Nephews and Nieces of Alice's Paternal Uncle:**    - The nephews and nieces are from his siblings.    - Since Alice's father has 4 daughters (Alice and her 3 sisters), there must be another sibling who has 1 child to make up the total of 5 nephews and nieces.  **Total Cousins:**  - **Maternal Cousins:** 2 (from her mother's brothers) - **Paternal Cousins:** 2 (the son of her father's brother and the child of the other sibling)  **Therefore, the total number of cousins that Alice's sister has is 4.**  ### Answer: 4",

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we need to construct a family tree step by step.  **On Alice's mother's side:** - Alice's mother has:   - 1 sister who has **no children**.   - That sister has **6 nephews and nieces**. Since she has no children, these must be the children of her siblings.   - She also has **2 brothers**.  Let\u2019s let: - **M** = Alice's mother - **NS** = Alice's aunt with no children - **U1** and **U2** = Alice's uncles (her mother's brothers)  Since NS has **6 nephews and nieces**, the total number of children among M, U1, and U2 is **6**.  From the problem, Alice has **3 sisters**, and it's implied she also has a **brother** (since elsewhere it mentions 5 nephews and nieces). Therefore, Alice's mother has **5 children**.  So: - M's children = 5 (Alice, her 3 sisters, and 1 brother) - That leaves 1 child to be split between U1 and U2 since 5 (M's children) + 1 (from U1 or U2) = 6 total nephews and nieces.  So on her mother's side, Alice's sister has **1 cousin** (the child of one of the uncles).  **On Alice's father's side:** - Alice's father has:   - A brother who has **1 son**.   - That brother has **5 nephews and nieces**.  Let\u2019s let: - **F** = Alice's father - **UB** = Alice's uncle (her father's brother)  Assuming F and UB are the only siblings, the 5 nephews and nieces of UB must be F's children.  So, F has **5 children** (Alice, her 3 sisters, and 1 brother), which aligns with our earlier assumption.  So on her father's side, Alice's sister has **1 cousin** (the son of UB).  **Total Cousins:** - Mother's side: **1 cousin** - Father's side: **1 cousin** - **Total**: 1 + 1 = **2 cousins**  ### Answer: 2",
