        "model_response":"To determine how many cousins Alice's sister has, let's break down the information step by step:  1. **Alice's Immediate Family:**    - Alice has **3 sisters**, making a total of **4 children** in the family (including Alice).  2. **Mother's Side:**    - **Mother's Sister (Aunt):** Has **no children**, so no cousins from her.    - **Mother's Brothers (Uncles):** There are **2 brothers**. Together, they have **6 children**. These children are Alice's cousins.  3. **Father's Side:**    - **Father's Brother (Uncle):**      - Has **1 son**.      - Has **5 nephews and nieces**. These nephews and nieces come from other siblings of the father.    - This implies there are additional siblings (besides the one uncle mentioned) who have children, contributing to the count of cousins.    - Therefore, from the father's side, there are **5 cousins**.  4. **Total Cousins:**    - **From Mother's Side:** 6 cousins.    - **From Father's Side:** 5 cousins.    - **Total:** 6 + 5 = **11 cousins**.  ### Answer: 11",
