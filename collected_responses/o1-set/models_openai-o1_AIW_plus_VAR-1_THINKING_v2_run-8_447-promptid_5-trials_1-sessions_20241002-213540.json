        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's carefully map out the family relationships step by step:  1. **Alice's Immediate Family**: Alice has 2 sisters. Since Uncle F (Alice's father's brother) has 5 nephews and nieces, and he only has one sibling (Alice's father), these nephews and nieces must be Alice and her siblings. Therefore, Alice's father has 5 children in total. Alice and her 2 sisters account for 3, so there must be 2 more siblings (brothers or sisters). Thus, Alice has 4 siblings.  2. **Maternal Side (Alice's Mother's Family)**:    - **Aunt M**: Alice's mother's sister who has no children.    - **Uncle1 and Uncle2**: Alice's mother's brothers.    - Aunt M has 6 nephews and nieces, who are the children of her siblings (Alice's mother, Uncle1, and Uncle2). We already know Alice's mother has 5 children. Therefore, Uncle1 and Uncle2 together have 1 child (since 5 [from Alice's mother] + 1 [from uncles] = 6 nephews and nieces).  3. **Paternal Side (Alice's Father's Family)**:    - **Uncle F**: Alice's father's brother who has 2 daughters.    - Uncle F has 5 nephews and nieces (the children of his sibling, Alice's father). Since Alice's father has 5 children, this accounts for Uncle F's nephews and nieces.  4. **Total Cousins for Alice's Sister**:    - **Maternal Cousins**: 1 cousin (child of either Uncle1 or Uncle2).    - **Paternal Cousins**: 2 cousins (Uncle F's daughters).    - **Total**: 1 (maternal) + 2 (paternal) = **3 cousins**.  ### Answer: 3",

        "model_response":"To solve this problem step by step:  1. **Alice's Siblings**: Alice has 2 sisters, meaning there are 3 sisters in total in her immediate family (Alice and her 2 sisters).

These are the children of her siblings (Alice's mother and the two brothers).    - Since Alice's mother has **3 daughters** (Alice and her 2 sisters), the two brothers must have **3 children** among them (because 6 total nephews and nieces minus 3 nieces from Alice's mother leaves 3 nephews\/nieces from the brothers).  3. **Paternal Side**:    - Alice's **father** has a **brother** who has **2 daughters**.    - This **uncle** has **5 nephews and nieces**. These are the children of his siblings.    - Since Alice's father is only mentioned to have one brother, we infer there is another sibling (not directly mentioned), who has **2 children** (because 5 total nephews and nieces minus 3 from Alice's family leaves 2 from the other sibling).  4. **Total Cousins**:    - On the **maternal side**, Alice's sister has **3 cousins** (the children of the two maternal uncles).    - On the **paternal side**, Alice's sister has **2 cousins** (the daughters of the paternal uncle).    - **Total cousins** = 3 (maternal) + 2 (paternal) = **5**.  ### Answer: 5",
