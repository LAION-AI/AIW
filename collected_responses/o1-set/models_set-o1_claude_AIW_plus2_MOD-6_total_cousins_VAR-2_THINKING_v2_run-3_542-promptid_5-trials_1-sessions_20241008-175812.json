Let's focus on the uncle (father's brother):    - This uncle has 1 nephew and 3 nieces    - This uncle has 1 son  5. The key information here is that Alice's father's brother has 1 son. This son is Alice's cousin.  6. We don't have any information about children from Alice's mother's brothers or father's sisters.  7. Therefore, the only confirmed cousin we can count is the 1 son of Alice's father's brother.  8. Since the question asks about Alice's sister's cousins, and Alice and her siblings would share the same cousins, the answer remains 1.  Double-checking: - We didn't use the information about Alice's mother's sister's nephews and nieces, as it doesn't directly give us information about Alice's cousins. - We also didn't use the information about Alice's father's brother's nephew and nieces, as this likely includes Alice and her siblings. - The only direct information about a cousin is the son of Alice's father's brother.  ### Answer: 1",

We don't have direct information about the children of Alice's mother's brothers or father's sisters. However, we can deduce some information:     - Alice's mother's sister (who has no children) has 2 nephews and 4 nieces in total.    - These 6 children must be from Alice's mother's brothers, as the sister has no children.    - This matches with Alice and her siblings (1 brother, 2 sisters, and Alice herself = 4)  7. So, from Alice's mother's side, there are 6 cousins (2 boys and 4 girls)  8. From Alice's father's side, we know his brother has 1 son.    We don't know about his sisters' children, but we know his brother has 1 nephew and 3 nieces in total.    This suggests that Alice's father's sisters have no children, as these numbers match Alice and her siblings.  9. Therefore, from Alice's father's side, there is 1 cousin (the son of her father's brother)  10. Total cousins: 6 (from mother's side) + 1 (from father's side) = 7  After careful consideration and double-checking, I believe this is the correct solution.  ### Answer: 7",

Now, we need to determine how many cousins Alice's sister has. Cousins would come from:    - Mother's brothers' children    - Father's sisters' children    - Father's brother's children  6. We know that father's brother has 1 son, so that's 1 cousin.  7. We don't have direct information about mother's brothers' children or father's sisters' children.  8. However, we can deduce this information from the aunt on mother's side:    - She has 2 nephews and 4 nieces in total    - We know 1 nephew is Alice's brother    - The other nephew must be the son of father's brother (as we know he has a son)    - This leaves 4 nieces, which must be Alice and her 2 sisters, plus 1 more  9. So, in total, there are:    - 1 cousin from father's brother    - 1 cousin deduced from the aunt's nieces\/nephews count  Therefore, Alice's sister has 2 cousins.  ### Answer: 2",

Alice's mother's side:    - Alice's mother has 2 brothers.    - Alice's mother also has 1 sister who does not have children.    - The sister has 2 nephews and 4 nieces in total.    - Since Alice's mother has 3 daughters and 1 son, and her sister does not have children, the 2 nephews and 4 nieces must be from the 2 brothers.  3. Alice's father's side:    - Alice's father has 2 sisters.    - Alice's father also has a brother who has 1 nephew and 3 nieces in total, and who also has 1 son.    - The 1 nephew and 3 nieces of Alice's father's brother are Alice and her siblings.  4.
