        "model_response":"To solve this problem step by step:  1. **Alice's immediate family**: Alice has 3 sisters, so there are 4 siblings in total (Alice + 3 sisters).  2. **Maternal side**:    - **Alice's mother** has:      - 1 sister **who does not have children**.      - 2 brothers.    - The mother has **7 nephews and nieces**, which are her siblings' children. Since her sister has no children, these 7 are from her 2 brothers.    - Therefore, **Alice has 7 maternal cousins** from her mother's brothers.  3. **Paternal side**:    - **Alice's father** has:      - A brother (Uncle1) who has **1 son**.      - Uncle1 has **5 nephews and nieces**. These are the children of his siblings.    - Since **Alice and her sisters** are 4 of those nephews\/nieces, there must be another sibling (Uncle2 or Aunt2) with at least **1 child** to make up the total of 5 nephews\/nieces for Uncle1.    - Therefore, **Alice has 1 cousin from Uncle1** and **1 cousin from the other sibling**.  4. **Total cousins**:    - **Maternal cousins**: 7.    - **Paternal cousins**: 1 (Uncle1's son) + 1 (from the other sibling) = 2.    - Therefore, **Alice has a total of 7 + 2 = 9 cousins**.  ### Answer: 9",

The problem does not state that she doesn't have any brothers, so let's consider that possibility due to the information given later.    **Mother's Side:** - Alice's mother has:   - **1 sister** who does **not** have children.   - **2 brothers**. - The mother's sister (Alice's aunt) has **7 nephews and nieces**.    - Since she has no children, her nephews and nieces are the children of her siblings: Alice's mother and her two brothers. - Alice's mother has at least **4 children** (Alice and her 3 sisters). - If we assume Alice has a brother (making **5 children**), this aligns with the aunt's **7 nephews and nieces**:   - Alice's family contributes **5 nieces\/nephews**.   - The 2 brothers together have **2 children** (7 total nephews and nieces - 5 from Alice's family = 2 from the brothers). - **Cousins on Mother's Side:** Alice has **2 cousins** from her uncles (her mother's brothers).  **Father's Side:** - Alice's father has a brother who has:   - **1 son** (Alice's cousin).   - **5 nephews and nieces**. - The father's brother's nephews and nieces are his siblings' children. If Alice's father has only Alice and her 3 sisters, that totals **4 nieces** for the brother, which doesn't match the **5 nephews and nieces** stated. - If we again assume that Alice has a brother (her father's son), then Alice's father has **5 children**, and the brother would have **5 nephews and nieces**. - **Cousins on Father's Side:** Alice has **1 cousin** (her uncle's son).  **Total Cousins:** - **2 cousins** on her mother's side. - **1 cousin** on her father's side. - **Total**: **3 cousins**.  ### Answer: 3",
