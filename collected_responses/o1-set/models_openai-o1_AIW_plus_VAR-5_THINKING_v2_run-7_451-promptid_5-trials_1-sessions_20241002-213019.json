        "model_response":"To determine how many cousins Alice's sister has, we need to consider the children of Alice's parents' siblings.  1. **Alice's Immediate Family**:    - Alice has **3 sisters**.    - Since we deduced from the father's side (explained below) that Alice must also have **1 brother**, Alice's immediate family has **5 children** (Alice, 3 sisters, and 1 brother).  2. **Mother's Side**:    - Alice's mother has:      - 1 sister who **does not have children**.      - 2 brothers.    - The childless sister has **6 nephews and nieces**. These are the children of her siblings (since she has no children).      - From Alice's mother: **5 children** (Alice's immediate family).      - Therefore, the two brothers must have **1 child** between them (since 6 nephews and nieces - 5 from Alice's mother = 1 from the brothers).    - So, on the mother's side, Alice's sister has **1 cousin**.  3. **Father's Side**:    - Alice's father has a brother who has:      - **1 son** (Alice's cousin).      - **5 nephews and nieces**. These are the children of his siblings.      - Assuming Alice's father and his brother are the only siblings, the **5 nephews and nieces** are Alice and her siblings (which we deduced to be 5, confirming Alice has a brother).    - So, on the father's side, Alice's sister has **1 cousin**.  4. **Total Cousins**:    - Sum of cousins from both sides: **1 (mother's side) + 1 (father's side) = 2 cousins**.  **Answer**: 2",

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we'll calculate the number of cousins Alice's sister has, which is the same as the number of cousins Alice has.  1. **Alice's Immediate Family**     - Alice has 3 sisters, which means there are 4 siblings in Alice's family.    - The problem doesn't state that Alice has no brothers, but later calculations will clarify this.  2. **Maternal Side**     - **Alice's Mother** has:      - **1 sister** who has **no children**.      - **2 brothers**.    - **Alice's Mother's Sister** (Aunt) has **6 nephews and nieces**.      - Her nephews and nieces are the children of her siblings (Alice's mother and her two brothers).    - Let the number of children of Alice's mother be **M**, and the brothers have **B1** and **B2** children respectively.    - So, **M + B1 + B2 = 6**.    - Alice's mother has 4 children (Alice and her 3 sisters), so **M = 4**.    - Therefore, **B1 + B2 = 6 - 4 = 2**.    - This means the two brothers have a total of **2 children**, so Alice has **2 cousins on her mother's side**.  3. **Paternal Side**     - **Alice's Father** has:      - **1 brother** who has **1 son**.      - The brother has **5 nephews and nieces**.    - His nephews and nieces are the children of his siblings (Alice's father).    - Let the number of children of Alice's father be **F**.    - So, **F = 5** (since the brother has 5 nephews and nieces).    - Alice's father has 4 daughters (Alice and her sisters) and possibly **1 son** to make it 5 children in total.    - Therefore, Alice has **1 brother**.    - Alice has **1 cousin on her father's side** (the son of her father's brother).  4. **Total Cousins**     - **Total cousins** Alice's sister has are **2 (maternal) + 1 (paternal) = 3 cousins**.  But there seems to be a discrepancy here. Our earlier calculation said there is 1 cousin on the paternal side, not 2.  Wait, but when we did the maternal side we ended up with 2 cousins, and in the previous step we said Alice has **2 cousins on her mother's side**. Let's double-check.  We found the brothers B1 and B2 have together 2 children. Therefore, Alice has 2 cousins on her mother's side.  Similarly, on her father's side, Alice's uncle has 1 son. So Alice has 1 cousin on her father's side.  Thus, the total number of cousins Alice's sister has is 2 (maternal) + 1 (paternal) = 3 cousins.  Wait, but earlier we thought the total cousins were 2, but our calculations now say 3. So the correct total number would be 3.  So the answer is:  ### Answer: 3",
