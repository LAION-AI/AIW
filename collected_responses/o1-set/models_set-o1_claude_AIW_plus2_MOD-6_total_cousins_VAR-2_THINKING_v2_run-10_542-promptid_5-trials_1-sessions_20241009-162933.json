Maternal Side:** - **Alice's Mother** has:   - **1 sister** (who has no children)   - **2 brothers**  - The childless aunt (mother's sister) has **2 nephews and 4 nieces**.

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's analyze the information step by step.  1. **Alice's Immediate Family**: The statement \"Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother in total\" is typically interpreted to mean Alice has **3 siblings**: 2 sisters and 1 brother. Therefore, Alice's immediate family consists of **4 children** (including Alice herself).  2. **Mother's Side**:    - **Alice's Mother** has **2 brothers** and **1 sister** who has no children.    - The sister (Alice's maternal aunt) has **2 nephews and 4 nieces**. Since she has no children, these nephews and nieces are her siblings' children.    - Alice's mother has **4 children** (from point 1), contributing **1 nephew (the brother)** and **3 nieces** (Alice and her 2 sisters) to the aunt.    - This leaves **1 nephew and 1 niece** unaccounted for, which must be the children of the 2 brothers (Alice's maternal uncles).    - Therefore, the maternal uncles have **1 son and 1 daughter** between them.     3. **Father's Side**:    - **Alice's Father** has **2 sisters** and **1 brother**.    - The brother (Alice's paternal uncle) has **1 son**.    - The brother also has **1 nephew and 3 nieces**, who are the children of his siblings.    - Since Alice's father has **4 children** (from point 1), they are **1 nephew (the brother)** and **3 nieces** (Alice and her 2 sisters) to the uncle.    - This implies the 2 sisters (paternal aunts) have **no children**.  4. **Total Cousins for Alice's Sister**:    - **Maternal Side**: 1 cousin from Uncle 1 (either son or daughter) and 1 cousin from Uncle 2 (either son or daughter) for a total of **2 cousins**.    - **Paternal Side**: 1 cousin from the paternal uncle (his son) for a total of **1 cousin**.    - **Total**: 2 (maternal) + 1 (paternal) = **3 cousins**.  ### Answer: 3",

        "model_response":"To determine how many cousins Alice's sister has, let's break down the information step by step:  1. **Alice's Immediate Family:**    - **Siblings:** Alice has 2 sisters (including the sister in question) and 1 brother. So, there are 4 children in total: Alice, Sister A (no children), Sister B, and Brother.     2. **Siblings' Children:**    - **Sister A:** Has no children but has 2 nephews and 4 nieces through her siblings. This means:      - **Brother:** Has 2 sons (the nephews).      - **Sister B:** Has 4 daughters (the nieces).  3. **Parents' Siblings:**    - **Mother's Side:** Alice's mother has 2 brothers (maternal uncles). No information is provided about their children.    - **Father's Side:**       - **Aunts:** Father has 2 sisters.      - **Uncle:** Father has 1 brother who has:        - 1 son (his own child).        - 1 nephew and 3 nieces in total from his siblings (which includes Alice, Sister A, Sister B, and the Brother).  4. **Cousins Calculation:**    - **From Father's Side:**      - **Uncle's Children:** 1 son.      - **Aunts' Children:** 1 daughter (since the uncle has 1 nephew and 3 nieces, and 2 nieces come from Alice and Sister A, the remaining niece likely comes from the aunts).    - **From Mother's Side:** No information is provided about the children of the maternal uncles.  Therefore, based on the available information, Alice's sister has **2 cousins** from the paternal side.  ### Answer: 2",

Given the maternal aunt has 2 nephews and 4 nieces, we can infer there are **6 cousins** from the mother's side.    - **From Father's Side:** The paternal uncle has 1 son, and the paternal aunts' children would add to the count.
