These include Alice and her 3 sisters (4 cousins) plus one additional child from another sibling (likely a sister), totaling 5.      - **Own Son:** The uncle also has 1 son, who is another cousin to Alice and her sisters.  4. **Total Cousins:**    - **From Mother's Side:** 6 cousins.    - **From Father's Side:** 2 cousins (1 from the uncle's side and 1 additional).

        "model_response":"Let's break down the problem step by step to determine how many cousins Alice's sister has.  **1. Understanding Alice's Immediate Family:** - **Alice** has **3 sisters**, making a total of **4** children in her immediate family (including Alice).  **2. Mother's Side of the Family:** - **Mother** has **1 sister** who **does not have children**. - This sister has **6 nephews and nieces**, which must come from the mother's **2 brothers** (since the sister herself has no children). - Therefore, the mother's **2 brothers** have a combined total of **6 children**. These children are Alice's cousins from her mother's side.  **3. Father's Side of the Family:** - **Father** has **1 brother**. - This brother has **5 nephews and nieces** in total. - Since Alice and her 3 sisters are **4 children**, these account for **4 of the 5 nephews and nieces**. - The brother also has **1 son**, which brings the total to **5**, matching the description.  **4. Calculating Total Cousins:** - **From Mother's Side:** 6 cousins. - **From Father's Side:** 5 cousins. - **Total Cousins:** 6 (mother's side) + 5 (father's side) = **11 cousins**.  However, considering that Alice's father has only one brother and the brother has 5 nephews and nieces (which includes Alice and her 3 sisters), this suggests there might be another child not initially accounted for. To reconcile:  - **Father's Side Adjusted Cousins:** 5 cousins. - **Mother's Side Cousins:** 6 cousins. - **Total Cousins:** 5 + 6 = **11 cousins**.  **Final Answer:**  ### Answer: 11",
