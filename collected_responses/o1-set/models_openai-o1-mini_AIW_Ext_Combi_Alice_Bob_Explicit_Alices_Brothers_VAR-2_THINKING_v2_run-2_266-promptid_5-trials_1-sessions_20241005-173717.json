        "model_response":"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many brothers Alice has.  1. **Understanding the Relationships:**    - Alice and Bob are siblings; Alice is the sister, and Bob is the brother.     2. **Alice's Siblings:**    - Alice has 2 sisters. Since Alice is also a sister, the total number of sisters in the family is:      \\[      \\text{Total Sisters} = \\text{Alice} + 2 = 3 \\text{ sisters}      \\]     3. **Bob's Siblings:**    - Bob has 2 brothers. Including Bob himself, the total number of brothers is:      \\[      \\text{Total Brothers} = \\text{Bob} + 2 = 3 \\text{ brothers}      \\]     4. **Determining Alice's Brothers:**    - Since Alice is a sister, her brothers are the same as the total number of brothers in the family.    - Therefore, Alice has 3 brothers.  ### Answer: 3",
