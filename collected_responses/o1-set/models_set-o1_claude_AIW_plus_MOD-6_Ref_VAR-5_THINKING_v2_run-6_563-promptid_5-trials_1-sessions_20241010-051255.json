Alice's Immediate Family:** - Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother. So, Alice's parents have **4 children** in total (Alice + 2 sisters + 1 brother).  **2. Maternal Side of the Family:** - **Alice's Mother has:**   - **2 brothers (Maternal Uncles).**   - **1 sister who has no children** but **has 6 nephews and nieces** in total. Since this sister has no children, her 6 nephews and nieces must be the children of her siblings (Alice's mother and her two brothers).    - **Calculating the Children on the Maternal Side:**   - Alice's mother has **4 children** (from point 1).   - Let\u2019s denote the total children of the two maternal uncles as **X**.   - The total nephews and nieces of the childless sister are then: **4 (Alice's mother\u2019s children) + X (children of the two maternal uncles) = 6**.   - Solving for **X**: **4 + X = 6 \u21d2 X = 2**.   - Therefore, the two maternal uncles have **2 children in total**.  **3. Paternal Side of the Family:** - **Alice's Father has:**   - **2 sisters (Paternal Aunts).**   - **1 brother who has 1 son** and **5 nephews and nieces** in total. Since this brother has 1 son, his 5 nephews and nieces must be the children of his siblings (Alice's father and his two sisters).    - **Calculating the Children on the Paternal Side:**   - Alice's father has **4 children** (from point 1).   - Let\u2019s denote the total children of the two paternal aunts as **Y**.   - The total nephews and nieces of the brother are then: **4 (Alice's father's children) + Y (children of the two paternal aunts) = 5**.   - Solving for **Y**: **4 + Y = 5 \u21d2 Y = 1**.   - Therefore, the two paternal aunts have **1 child in total**.  **4. Total Cousins Alice's Sister Has:** - On the **maternal side**: **2 children** (from the maternal uncles). - On the **paternal side**: **1 child** (from paternal aunts) + **1 child** (the son of the paternal uncle) = **2 children**. - Therefore, the total number of cousins is: **2 (maternal) + 2 (paternal) = 4 cousins**.  ### Answer: 4",

        "model_response":"Let's think through this step-by-step:  1. First, let's identify Alice's siblings:    - Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother    - So, there are 4 children in Alice's family (including Alice)  2. Now, let's look at Alice's mother's side:    - Her mother has 2 brothers and 1 sister    - The sister doesn't have children    - The sister has 6 nephews and nieces in total  3. Alice's father's side:    - Her father has 2 sisters and 1 brother    - The brother has 5 nephews and nieces in total    - The brother has 1 son  4. To find Alice's sister's cousins, we need to count the children of Alice's aunts and uncles (excluding Alice and her siblings):     From mother's side:    - 2 uncles: We don't know how many children they have, but we know the total nephews and nieces of the mother's sister is 6.    - Since Alice and her 3 siblings account for 4 of these, the 2 uncles must have 2 children in total (6 - 4 = 2)     From father's side:    - 2 aunts: We don't know how many children they have    - 1 uncle: We know he has 1 son    - We also know that this uncle has 5 nephews and nieces in total    - 4 of these are Alice and her siblings, so the 2 aunts must have 1 child in total (5 - 4 = 1)  5. Adding up the cousins:    - 2 from mother's side    - 1 from father's aunts    - 1 from father's uncle        Total: 4 cousins  Double-checking: - We've accounted for all aunts and uncles - We've used all the information provided - Our calculations align with the given numbers of nephews and nieces  Therefore, Alice's sister has 4 cousins.  ### Answer: 4",

Now, let's look at Alice's mother's side:    - Her mother has 2 brothers    - Her mother has 1 sister (Alice's aunt) who has no children  3. On Alice's father's side:    - Her father has 2 sisters    - Her father has 1 brother who has 1 son  4. We need to count Alice's cousins, which would be the children of her aunts and uncles:     Mother's side:    - 2 uncles: We don't know how many children they have     Father's side:    - 2 aunts: We don't know how many children they have    - 1 uncle: We know he has 1 son  5. We're given two pieces of information about nephews and nieces:    - Alice's mother's sister (who has no children) has 6 nephews and nieces    - Alice's father's brother has 5 nephews and nieces  6. The 6 nephews and nieces of Alice's mother's sister must be:    - Alice and her 3 siblings (4 total)    - Plus 2 more, who must be cousins from her mother's brothers  7. The 5 nephews and nieces of Alice's father's brother must be:    - Alice and her 3 siblings (4 total)    - Plus 1 more, who must be a cousin from one of Alice's father's sisters  8. So, we can conclude:    - 2 cousins from mother's side    - 1 cousin from father's sisters    - 1 cousin from father's brother (his son)  9. Total cousins: 2 + 1 + 1 = 4  10. The question asks for Alice's sister's cousins, which would be the same as Alice's cousins.  Therefore, the final answer is:  ### Answer: 4",

The problem doesn't provide information about their children, so we assume they have no children (0 cousins from the mother's side).  3. **Father's Side:**    - **Aunts and Uncles:** Alice's father has 2 sisters (paternal aunts) and 1 brother (paternal uncle).    - **Paternal Uncle:** He has 1 son.    - **Paternal Aunts:** Collectively, Alice's paternal aunts have 1 child.  4. **Total Cousins:**    - **From Father's Side:** 1 son (from paternal uncle) + 1 child (from paternal aunts) = **2 cousins**.    - **From Mother's Side:** 0 cousins (based on the given information).
