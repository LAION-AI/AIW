        "model_response":"To determine how many brothers Alice has, let's carefully analyze the given information step by step.  1. **Alice has 2 sisters.**    - This means **in addition to herself**, Alice has 2 sisters. Therefore, there are **3 girls** in the family (Alice + 2 sisters).  2. **Bob has 3 brothers.**    - Similarly, **in addition to himself**, Bob has 3 brothers. So there are **4 boys** in the family (Bob + 3 brothers).  3. **Alice and Bob are siblings.**    - They are part of the same family.  4. **Total number of children in the family:**    - Girls: 3 (from point 1)    - Boys: 4 (from point 2)    - **Total children:** 3 girls + 4 boys = **7 children**  5. **Brothers of Alice:**    - The brothers in the family are the boys. So Alice's brothers are the **4 boys** (Bob and his 3 brothers).  ### Answer: 4",
