        "model_response":"To solve the problem step by step:  1. **Alice's Immediate Family**:    - Alice has 3 sisters, so there are 4 siblings in total.  2. **Maternal Side**:    - Alice's mother has:      - **1 sister** who **does not have children** but has **6 nephews and nieces**.      - **2 brothers**.    - The **6 nephews and nieces** of Alice's mother's sister are:      - **Alice and her 3 sisters** (4 nieces).      - **Children of the 2 brothers** (Alice's maternal uncles).    - Therefore, the 2 brothers have a total of **2 children** (since 6 - 4 = 2).    - So, Alice has **2 cousins** on her maternal side.  3. **Paternal Side**:    - Alice's father has:      - **1 brother** who has:        - **4 nephews and nieces**.        - **1 son** (Alice's cousin).    - The **4 nephews and nieces** are **Alice and her 3 sisters**.    - So, Alice has **1 cousin** on her paternal side.  4. **Total Cousins Alice's Sister Has**:    - Adding maternal and paternal cousins: **2 + 1 = 3 cousins**.  ### Answer: 3",

        "model_response":"To determine the number of cousins that Alice's sister has, we need to carefully analyze Alice's family tree, considering both her maternal and paternal relatives.  **1. Alice's Immediate Family:** - Alice has **3 sisters**. So, there are **4 siblings** in total (Alice and her 3 sisters).  **2. Maternal Side:** - **Alice's Mother** has:   - **1 Sister** (Alice's Aunt):     - She **does not have children**.     - She has **6 nephews and nieces**.     - She also has **2 brothers** (Alice's maternal uncles).      - Since the aunt has no children, her **6 nephews and nieces** must come from her siblings (Alice's mother and her 2 brothers).  - **Calculating the nephews and nieces:**   - Alice's mother has **4 children** (Alice and her 3 sisters).   - Therefore, the **2 brothers** have a combined total of **2 children** (since 6 nephews and nieces minus the 4 from Alice's mother equals 2).    - **Maternal Cousins:**   - Alice's maternal cousins are the children of her maternal uncles.   - Total maternal cousins = **2 children** from the maternal uncles.  **3. Paternal Side:** - **Alice's Father** has:   - **1 Brother** (Alice's uncle):     - He has **1 son** (Alice's cousin).     - He has **4 nephews and nieces**.      - The uncle's **4 nephews and nieces** are Alice and her 3 sisters.    - **Paternal Cousins:**   - Alice's paternal cousin is the **1 son** of her uncle.   - Total paternal cousins = **1**.  **4. Total Cousins:** - Total cousins = Maternal cousins + Paternal cousins - Total cousins = **2 (maternal)** + **1 (paternal)** = **3**.  ### Answer: 3",

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cousins Alice's sister has, which is the same as the total number of cousins Alice and her sisters have.  **Step 1: Identify Alice's siblings.** - Alice has **3 sisters**, so there are **4 siblings** in total (including Alice).  **Step 2: Analyze the maternal side (Alice's mother's family).** - Alice's mother has **1 sister** (who has no children) and **2 brothers**. - The mother's sister (Alice's aunt) has **6 nephews and nieces**. - Since the aunt has no children, her nephews and nieces are the children of her siblings (Alice's mother and her two brothers). - Alice's mother has **4 children** (Alice and her sisters). - Therefore, the aunt's nephews and nieces from the brothers must be **2** (since 6 total nephews\/nieces - 4 from Alice's mother = 2). - So, Alice has **2 cousins on her mother's side** (children of her uncles).  **Step 3: Analyze the paternal side (Alice's father's family).** - Alice's father has **1 brother** who has **1 son**. - The father's brother has **4 nephews and nieces**, who are the children of his sibling (Alice's father). Since Alice's father has 4 daughters, this makes sense. - Therefore, Alice has **1 cousin on her father's side** (the son of her uncle).  **Step 4: Sum up the total number of cousins.** - Total cousins = **2 (maternal side) + 1 (paternal side) = 3 cousins**.  ### Answer: 3",
