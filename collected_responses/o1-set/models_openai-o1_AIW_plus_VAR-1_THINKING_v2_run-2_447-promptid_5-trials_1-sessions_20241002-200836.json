        "model_response":"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information step by step:  **1. Alice's Immediate Family:** - Alice has 2 sisters. So, there are **3 children** in Alice's immediate family.  **2. Maternal Side:** - Alice's mother has:   - 1 sister who **does not have children**.   - 2 brothers. - The childless sister has **6 nephews and nieces**. Since she has no children, these are the children of her siblings (Alice's mother and the 2 brothers). - Alice's mother has 3 daughters (Alice and her 2 sisters). - Therefore, the 2 brothers must have a total of **3 children** (since 6 - 3 = 3). - So, on the maternal side, Alice's sister has **3 cousins** (the children of her uncles).  **3. Paternal Side:** - Alice's father has:   - 1 brother who has **2 daughters**.   - The uncle has **5 nephews and nieces**. These are the children of his siblings. - Alice's father has 3 daughters (Alice and her 2 sisters). - To account for the 5 nephews and nieces, there must be another sibling (since 3 from Alice's father + 2 from another sibling = 5). - This means there's an additional aunt or uncle who has **2 children**. - So, on the paternal side, Alice's sister has **4 cousins** (2 from the uncle with 2 daughters and 2 from the other sibling).  **4. Total Cousins:** - Maternal cousins: **3** - Paternal cousins: **4** - **Total cousins:** 3 + 4 = **7**  ### Answer: 7",

Since Aunt A doesn't have children, her **6 nephews and nieces** come from her siblings: - Alice's mother's children: **3 daughters** (Alice and her sisters). - Uncle B1 and Uncle B2's children: Combined **3 children** (since 6 total nephews and nieces - 3 from Alice's mother = 3 from the uncles).
