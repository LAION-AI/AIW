Since this sister has no children of her own, these nephews and nieces come from Alice's immediate siblings.

The question doesn't mention if these brothers have children, so we don't have enough information about cousins from Alice's mother's side.  3. Alice's mother has 1 sister who does not have children. This sister has 3 nephews and 4 nieces in total. These nephews and nieces are Alice's cousins. So, from Alice's mother's side, she has 3 + 4 = 7 cousins.  4. Alice's father has 2 sisters. The question doesn't mention if these sisters have children, so we don't have enough information about cousins from this part of Alice's father's side.  5. Alice's father has a brother who has 1 nephew and 4 nieces in total. This brother also has 1 son. The nephew and nieces are Alice's cousins, but the son is not because he is the cousin's sibling. So, from Alice's father's side, she has 1 + 4 = 5 cousins.  6. In total, Alice has 7 cousins from her mother's side and 5 cousins from her father's side, which adds up to 12 cousins.  7. The question asks how many cousins Alice's sister has. Since Alice and her siblings have the same parents, they will have the same cousins. Therefore, Alice's sister also has 12 cousins.  Double-checking the solution: - The given information is correctly considered. - The cousins from Alice's mother's side and father's side are correctly calculated. - The total number of cousins is correctly added. - The reasoning for Alice's sister having the same number of cousins as Alice is correct.  ### Answer: Alice's sister has 12 cousins.",
