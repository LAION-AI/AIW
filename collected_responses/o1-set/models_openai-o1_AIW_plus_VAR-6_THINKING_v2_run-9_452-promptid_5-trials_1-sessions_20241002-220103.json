        "model_response":"To determine the number of cousins Alice's sister has, we need to analyze Alice's family tree step by step.  **Alice's Immediate Family:** - Alice has **2 sisters** (total of 3 daughters in her immediate family). - No brothers are mentioned, so we'll assume there are none.  **Maternal Side (Alice's Mother's Family):** - Alice's mother has:   - **1 sister (Aunt Cathy)** who **does not have children**.   - **2 brothers (Uncle Bob and Uncle Dan)**. - Aunt Cathy has **6 nephews and nieces**. Since she doesn't have children, these are the children of her siblings (Alice's mother, Uncle Bob, and Uncle Dan). - Alice and her sisters account for **3** of these nephews\/nieces. - Therefore, Uncle Bob and Uncle Dan have a total of **3 children** (6 total nephews\/nieces - 3 from Alice's family). - So, Alice has **3 maternal cousins** from her mother's side.  **Paternal Side (Alice's Father's Family):** - Alice's father has:   - **1 brother (Uncle Edward)** who has **2 daughters**.   - Uncle Edward has **4 nephews and nieces**. These are the children of his siblings. - Alice and her sisters account for **3** of these nephews\/nieces. - Therefore, there must be **1 more nephew\/niece**, indicating that Alice's father has **another sibling (possibly Aunt Fiona)** who has **1 child**. - So, Alice has **3 paternal cousins** (2 from Uncle Edward and 1 from the other sibling).  **Total Number of Cousins:** - **Maternal cousins**: 3 - **Paternal cousins**: 3 - **Total cousins**: **3 + 3 = 6**  ### Answer: 6",

        "model_response":"To solve this problem step by step, we need to determine the number of cousins that Alice's sister has. Since Alice and her sisters share the same cousins, we will find the total number of cousins they all have.  **On Alice's Mother's Side:**  1. Alice's mother has:    - 1 sister who has no children.    - 2 brothers.  2. The childless sister has 6 nephews and nieces. These are the children of her siblings (Alice's mother and two brothers).  3. Alice's mother has 3 children (Alice and her two sisters).  4. Therefore, the two brothers together have \\(6 - 3 = 3\\) children.  5. So, on her mother's side, Alice has **3 cousins** (children of her maternal uncles).  **On Alice's Father's Side:**  1. Alice's father has a brother who:    - Has 2 daughters.    - Has 4 nephews and nieces (children of his siblings).  2. Alice's father has 3 children (Alice and her two sisters).  3. Since the uncle has 4 nephews and nieces, there must be another sibling (besides Alice's father) who has \\(4 - 3 = 1\\) child.  4. Therefore, on her father's side, Alice has **2 cousins** from her uncle and **1 cousin** from the other sibling, totaling **3 cousins**.  **Total Number of Cousins:**  - Cousins on mother's side: 3 - Cousins on father's side: 3 - **Total cousins: \\(3 + 3 = 6\\)**  ### Answer: 6",

Since the Aunt doesn't have children, her nephews and nieces are the children of her siblings: - From Alice's mother: **3 children** (Alice and her 2 sisters). - Therefore, **Uncle John and Uncle Robert** together have **3 children** (since 6 total nephews and nieces - 3 from Alice's mother = 3 from the uncles).
