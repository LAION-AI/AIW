        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we'll carefully analyze the family relationships step by step.  **1. Alice's Immediate Family:** - **Alice has 2 sisters**, which means there are **3 sisters in total**: Alice, Sister 1, and Sister 2. - There's **no mention of brothers**, so we'll assume there are **no brothers** in Alice's immediate family.  **2. Alice's Mother's Siblings:** - **Sister (S1)**: Has **no children**. - **Brothers (B1 and B2)**: Number of children unknown. - **Important Detail**: S1 has **6 nephews and nieces**.  **3. Calculating Children of B1 and B2 (Mother's Side):** - S1's nephews and nieces are the children of her siblings (Alice's mother, B1, and B2). - Alice's mother has **3 children** (Alice and her 2 sisters). - Therefore, the children of B1 and B2 must total **6 - 3 = 3 children**. - **Conclusion**: B1 and B2 have **3 children in total**.    **4. Alice's Father's Siblings:** - **Brother (U1)**: Has **2 daughters**. - **Important Detail**: U1 has **5 nephews and nieces**.    **5. Determining Additional Siblings on Father's Side:** - U1's nephews and nieces are the children of his sibling(s). - Alice's father is one sibling, whose children are Alice and her 2 sisters (**3 children**). - Since U1 has **5 nephews and nieces**, there must be another sibling (let's call this sibling **F1**) who has **2 children**. - **Conclusion**: Alice's father has **another sibling (F1)** besides U1.  **6. Calculating Total Cousins:** - **From Mother's Side**:   - **Children of B1 and B2**: **3 cousins**. - **From Father's Side**:   - **Children of U1**: **2 daughters** (cousins).   - **Children of F1**: **2 children** (cousins).   - **Total cousins from father's side**: **2 + 2 = 4 cousins**.    **7. Total Number of Cousins Alice's Sister Has:** - **Total cousins**: **3 (mother's side) + 4 (father's side) = 7 cousins**.  ### Answer: 7 cousins",

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's methodically reconstruct Alice's family tree step by step.  **1. Alice's Immediate Family:** - Alice has 2 sisters. This implies Alice's family includes:   - Alice   - Sister 1   - Sister 2 - Given the context, we can infer that Alice might have additional siblings, possibly brothers.  **2. Paternal Side (Father's Family):** - Alice's father has a brother (her paternal uncle). - The uncle has 2 daughters (Alice's cousins on her father's side). - The uncle also has 5 nephews and nieces. Since these would be the children of his siblings, and assuming Alice's father is his only sibling, Alice's father must have 5 children. - Therefore, Alice's siblings likely include 2 brothers in addition to her 2 sisters and herself.  **3. Maternal Side (Mother's Family):** - Alice's mother has:   - 1 sister (childless aunt) who has 6 nephews and nieces.   - 2 brothers (Alice's maternal uncles). - The childless aunt's nephews and nieces are the children of her siblings:   - Alice's mother's children (Alice and her siblings).   - The children of the two brothers. - Since the aunt has 6 nephews and nieces and Alice's mother has 5 children, the two uncles must have 1 child between them.  **4. Calculating Alice's Sister's Cousins:** - **Paternal Cousins:** 2 (the daughters of Alice's father's brother). - **Maternal Cousins:** 1 (the child of one of Alice's mother's brothers). - **Total Cousins:** 2 (paternal) + 1 (maternal) = **3 cousins**.  ### Answer: 3",
