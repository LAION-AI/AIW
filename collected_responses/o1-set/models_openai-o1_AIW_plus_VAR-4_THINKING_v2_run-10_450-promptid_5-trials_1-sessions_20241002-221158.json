        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of cousins Alice's sister has, which is the same number as the cousins Alice has since they are sisters.  **Step 1: Analyze Alice's Family**  - **Alice has 4 sisters**, so there are **5 children** total in Alice's immediate family.  **Maternal Side:**  - **Alice's mother has:**   - **1 sister** who is **childless**.   - **2 brothers**. - **The childless sister has 6 nephews and nieces.**   - Since she has no children, these nephews and nieces must be the children of her siblings (Alice's mother and her two brothers). - **Alice's mother has 5 children** (Alice and her sisters). - Therefore, the **2 brothers together have 1 child** (since 5 [from Alice's mother] + 1 [from the brothers] = 6 nephews\/nieces).  **Paternal Side:**  - **Alice's father has a brother** who:   - **Has 1 son** (Alice's cousin).   - **Has 5 nephews and nieces.**     - These nephews and nieces are the children of his siblings. - Since there's no mention of other siblings, we infer that **Alice's father** is the only sibling, and his **5 children (Alice and her sisters)** are the **5 nephews and nieces**.  **Step 2: Calculate the Total Number of Cousins**  - **Maternal Cousins:**   - **1 child** from the maternal uncles. - **Paternal Cousins:**   - **1 son** from the paternal uncle.  **Total Cousins = 1 (maternal) + 1 (paternal) = 2 cousins**  ### Answer: 2",

        "model_response":"The key to solving this problem is to carefully parse the information and methodically deduce the family relationships.  1. **Alice's Immediate Family**: Alice has 4 sisters, which means her parents have 5 children in total (Alice + 4 sisters).  2. **Maternal Side**:    - **Alice's Mother** has:      - **1 Sister** who **does not have children**.      - **2 Brothers** (Alice's maternal uncles).    - The sister (Alice's aunt) has **6 nephews and nieces**. Since she has no children, these must be the children of her siblings (Alice's mother and the two brothers).    - Alice's mother has 5 children (Alice and her sisters).    - Therefore, the two brothers have **1 child between them** (because 5 [Alice's mother's children] + 1 [child of the brothers] = 6 [total nephews and nieces of the sister]).    - **Maternal Cousins**: Alice's sister has **1 cousin** on her mother's side (the child of her maternal uncles).  3. **Paternal Side**:    - **Alice's Father** has:      - **1 Brother** (Alice's paternal uncle) who has **1 son**.      - This brother has **5 nephews and nieces**, which are the children of his siblings. Since we are not told of any other siblings, we can infer that all 5 are the children of Alice's father.    - Alice's father has 5 children (Alice and her sisters).    - **Paternal Cousins**: Alice's sister has **1 cousin** on her father's side (the son of her paternal uncle).  4. **Total Cousins**: Adding the maternal and paternal cousins, Alice's sister has **1 + 1 = 2 cousins**.  ### Answer: 2",
