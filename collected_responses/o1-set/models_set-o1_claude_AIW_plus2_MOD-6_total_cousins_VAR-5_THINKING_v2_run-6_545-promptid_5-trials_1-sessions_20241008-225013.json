Alice's father has a brother who has 1 nephew and 4 nieces in total, and who also has 1 son.  Now, let's count the cousins of Alice's sister:  1. Alice's mother's side:    - Alice's mother has 2 brothers, so their children will be cousins to Alice and her siblings.    - However, the number of children of Alice's mother's brothers is not given, so we cannot count them.  2.

        "model_response":"Let's think through this step-by-step:  1. First, let's identify Alice's siblings:    - Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother  2. Now, let's look at Alice's mother's side:    - Mother has 2 brothers    - Mother has 1 sister with no children    - This sister has 2 nephews and 4 nieces in total  3. Let's examine Alice's father's side:    - Father has 2 sisters    - Father has 1 brother    - This brother has 1 nephew and 4 nieces in total    - This brother also has 1 son  4. To find Alice's sister's cousins, we need to count the children of Alice's aunts and uncles:     From mother's side:    - Mother's 2 brothers: We don't know if they have children    - Mother's sister: No children     From father's side:    - Father's 2 sisters: We don't know if they have children    - Father's brother: Has 1 son  5. The only definite cousin we can count is the son of Alice's father's brother.  6. We need to be careful not to confuse the information about nephews and nieces, as these could include Alice and her siblings.  7. Double-checking: We don't have enough information to determine if Alice's other aunts and uncles have children who would be cousins to Alice's sister.  Therefore, based on the given information, we can only confirm one cousin for Alice's sister.  ### Answer: 1",
