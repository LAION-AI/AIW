        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's carefully break it down step by step.  1. **Alice's Friends**:    - Alice has **2 female friends**: let's call them **F1** and **F2**.    - She also has **4 male friends**: let's call them **M1**, **M2**, **M3**, and **M4**.    - So, Alice's total number of friends is **6**.  2. **Friendships Among Alice's Friends**:    - The statement \"They all are friends with each other\" refers to Alice's friends being friends among themselves.    - This means every friend of Alice is friends with all the other friends of Alice.    - So, each person among **F1**, **F2**, **M1**, **M2**, **M3**, and **M4** is friends with the other five.  3. **Including Alice in Friendships**:    - Since Alice is friends with all these six people, and friendships are mutual, each of her friends is also friends with her.    - Therefore, each of Alice's friends has Alice as a friend.  4. **Total Friends of a Male Friend (e.g., M1)**:    - **M1's friends include**:      - **Alice** (since Alice is friends with M1).      - The other **2 female friends**: **F1** and **F2**.      - The other **3 male friends**: **M2**, **M3**, and **M4**.    - So, **M1** has a total of **6 friends** (including Alice and the other five friends).  5. **Counting Female Friends of M1**:    - The female friends of **M1** are:      - **Alice**      - **F1**      - **F2**    - Therefore, **M1** has **3 female friends**.  **Answer**: 3",

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's break down the given information step by step:  1. **Alice's Friends:**    - **Female Friends:** 2 (Let's call them F1 and F2)    - **Male Friends:** 4 (Let's call them M1, M2, M3, and M4)  2. **Friendship Dynamics:**    - All of Alice's friends are friends with each other. This means every friend of Alice is also friends with all of her other friends.    - They have no other friends aside from this group.  3. **Focus on a Male Friend:**    - Let's consider one of the male friends, say **M1**.  4. **Determining M1's Female Friends:**    - Since M1 is friends with all of Alice's friends, he is friends with both F1 and F2.    - There are no other females in the group, and since they have no other friends outside the group, these are the only female friends M1 has.  **Therefore, any male friend of Alice has 2 female friends.**  ### Answer: 2",

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the relationships within the group:  1. **Total People in the Group**:    - Alice    - 2 female friends    - 4 male friends    - **Total**: 1 (Alice) + 2 + 4 = **7 people**  2. **Friendship Dynamics**:    - Everyone is friends with each other.    - Each person has **6 friends** (since they are friends with everyone else).  3. **Identifying the Female Friends**:    - The females in the group are:      - Alice (female)      - 2 female friends      - **Total females**: 1 + 2 = **3 females**  4. **Determining the Number of Female Friends for a Male Friend**:    - A male friend is friends with all **6** other people.    - Among these 6 friends:      - **3 females** (Alice and the 2 female friends)      - **3 males** (the other male friends)    - Therefore, each male friend has **3 female friends**.  ### Answer: 3",
