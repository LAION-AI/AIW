        "model_response":"To determine how many cousins Alice's sister has, let's break down the information step by step:  1. **Alice's Immediate Family:**    - **Siblings:** Alice has 2 sisters, making a total of 3 children in her immediate family.  2. **Mother's Side:**    - **Aunt:** Alice's mother has 1 sister (the aunt) who does not have children.    - **Uncles:** The aunt has 2 brothers (Alice's maternal uncles).    - **Nephews and Nieces:** The aunt has 6 nephews and nieces. Since the aunt has no children, these 6 come from the uncles.    - **Children from Uncles:** Given that Alice and her 2 sisters account for 3 of these nieces and nephews, the uncles have 3 children in total (6 nephews and nieces - 3 from Alice's immediate family).  3. **Father's Side:**    - **Uncle:** Alice's father has 1 brother (the paternal uncle).    - **Children of Uncle:** This uncle has 2 daughters.    - **Nephews and Nieces:** The paternal uncle has 5 nephews and nieces, which include Alice and her 2 sisters, totaling 3. Therefore, the father must have 5 children in total, meaning Alice and her 2 sisters have 2 additional siblings.  4. **Calculating Cousins:**    - **From Mother's Side:** The uncles have 3 children, so Alice's sister has 3 cousins from the mother's side.    - **From Father's Side:** The paternal uncle has 2 daughters, so Alice's sister has 2 cousins from the father's side.  Adding them together: 3 (mother's side) + 2 (father's side) = **5 cousins**.  ### Answer: 5",

Since Aunt M has no children, these nephews and nieces must come from her 2 brothers and Alice's mother.   - Alice's mother has 3 daughters (Alice and her 2 sisters).   - Therefore, the 2 brothers must have a total of 3 children (since 3 daughters + 3 children from uncles = 6 nephews and nieces).  **3. Paternal Side:** - Alice's father has a brother (Uncle P). - Uncle P has 2 daughters. - Uncle P has 5 nephews and nieces in total. These come from the children of his siblings.   - Alice's father has 3 children (Alice and her 2 sisters).   - To reach 5 nephews and nieces, there must be 2 additional children from other siblings of Alice's father (e.g., another uncle or aunt with 2 children).  **4. Total Cousins:** - From the maternal side: 3 cousins (children of the maternal uncles). - From the paternal side: 5 cousins (including the 2 daughters of Uncle P and children from other paternal siblings).  **Therefore, Alice's sister has a total of 8 cousins.**  ### Answer: 8",
