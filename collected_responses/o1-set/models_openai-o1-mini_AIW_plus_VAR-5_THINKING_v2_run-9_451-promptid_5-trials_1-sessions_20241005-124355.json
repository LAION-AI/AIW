        "model_response":"Let's break down the problem step by step to determine how many cousins Alice's sister has.  **1. Alice's Immediate Family:** - Alice has 3 sisters, making a total of 4 daughters in the immediate family.  **2. Maternal Side (Mother's Siblings):** - Alice's mother has 1 sister (Maternal Aunt) who does not have children. - The maternal aunt has 2 brothers (Alice's maternal uncles). - These 2 uncles have a total of 6 nephews and nieces.   - Since the aunt has no children, all 6 nephews and nieces are Alice's cousins from the maternal side.  **3. Paternal Side (Father's Siblings):** - Alice's father has at least 1 brother (Paternal Uncle). - This paternal uncle has:   - 1 son of his own.   - 5 nephews and nieces.     - The nephews and nieces would be Alice's cousins from the paternal side. - Assuming the paternal uncle is the only brother, the total cousins from the paternal side would be:   - 1 (his own son) + 5 (nephews and nieces) = 6 cousins.  **4. Total Cousins:** - Maternal cousins: 6 - Paternal cousins: 6 - **Total cousins = 6 (maternal) + 6 (paternal) = 12**  **Conclusion:** Alice's sister has **12 cousins**.  ### Answer: 12",

        "model_response":"To determine how many cousins Alice's sister has, let's break down the information step by step:  1. **Alice and Her Siblings:**    - Alice has **3 sisters**, making a total of **4 children** (Alice + 3 sisters).  2. **Mother's Side:**    - Alice's mother has **1 sister (aunt)** who **does not have children**.    - The aunt has **2 brothers** (Alice's uncles).    - These 2 uncles have a total of **6 children** (Alice's cousins from the maternal side).  3. **Father's Side:**    - Alice's father has **1 brother (uncle)**.    - This uncle has **5 nephews and nieces**.    - Additionally, the uncle has **1 son**.        To account for the uncle having **5 nephews and nieces**, the father must have **5 children**. Given that Alice has **3 sisters**, the father must also have **1 brother** (making it 5 children in total: Alice, her 3 sisters, and 1 brother).  4. **Cousins Calculation:**    - **From the maternal side:** 6 cousins.    - **From the paternal side:** 5 cousins.    - **Total cousins:** 6 + 5 = **11 cousins**.
