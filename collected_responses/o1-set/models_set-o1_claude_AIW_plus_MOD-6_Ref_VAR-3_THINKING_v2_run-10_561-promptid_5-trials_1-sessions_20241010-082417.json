These nephews and nieces are the children of Alice and her other siblings.    - **Implication:** The 7 nephews and nieces come from the immediate family, indicating that Alice and her brother have a total of 7 children combined.  4. **Father's Side:**    - **Aunts:** Alice's father has 2 sisters.    - **Uncle:** Alice's father has 1 brother who has:      - **Children:** 1 son.      - **Nephews and Nieces:** 5 in total.    - **Implication:** The uncle's 5 nephews and nieces are part of Alice's immediate family, but since Alice and her siblings have 7 children, this suggests that the uncle has 5 children of his own.  5. **Total Cousins:**    - **From Mother's Side:** Assuming the nephews and nieces mentioned are separate from those on the father's side, the 7 from the mother's side and 5 from the father's uncle make a total of 12 cousins.  **Conclusion:** Alice's sister has a total of **12 cousins**.  ### Answer: 12",

These nephews and nieces must come from the children of Alice and her other siblings.    - Therefore, Alice and her siblings have a total of **7 children**.  3. **Father's Siblings**:    - **Father has 2 sisters** and **1 brother**.    - The brother has **1 son** and **5 nephews and nieces**.      - The **5 nephews and nieces** include Alice and her siblings' children (which total 7, but considering overlaps, it fits).  4. **Mother's Siblings**:    - **Mother has 2 brothers**. The number of their children isn't directly provided, but based on the nephews and nieces count, it's inferred that these brothers collectively have **2 children** to reach the total of 7 nephews and nieces.  5. **Total Cousins**:    - **Children from father's side**: 1 son from the brother + 1 child from the two sisters = **2 cousins**.    - **Children from mother's side**: **2 cousins** from the two brothers.    - Therefore, total cousins = **2 (father's side) + 2 (mother's side) = 4 cousins**.

First, let's identify Alice's siblings:    - Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother    - So, Alice's parents have 4 children in total  2. Now, let's look at Alice's mother's side:    - Her mother has 2 brothers    - Her mother has 1 sister (Alice's aunt) who has no children    - This aunt has 7 nephews and nieces in total  3. On Alice's father's side:    - Her father has 2 sisters    - Her father has 1 brother    - This uncle has 5 nephews and nieces in total    - This uncle also has 1 son  4.

We can use the information about nephews and nieces to figure out the number of cousins:    - Mother's side: The aunt with no children has 7 nephews and nieces      * 4 of these are Alice and her siblings      * The other 3 must be the children of the 2 uncles    - Father's side: The uncle has 5 nephews and nieces      * 4 of these are Alice and her siblings      * The 5th is his own son      * This means the 2 aunts on this side have no children  6.
