As he only has one sibling (Alice's father), these nephews and nieces must be Alice and her siblings.   - **2 daughters**. - Since the uncle has **4 nephews and nieces** from Alice's father, it means Alice's father has **4 children**.

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's carefully analyze the family relationships described:  1. **Alice's Immediate Family**:    - Alice has **2 sisters**, implying that her parents have **3 daughters (Alice and her 2 sisters)**.    - However, according to the information related to Alice's father's side, Alice's father must have **4 children**. This suggests that Alice also has a **brother**.     2. **Mother's Side of the Family**:    - Alice's mother has:      - **1 sister (Aunt A)** who **does not have children** but has **6 nephews and nieces**.      - **2 brothers (Uncle B and Uncle C)**.    - The **6 nephews and nieces** are the children of Aunt A's siblings (since she has none). So they are the children of Alice's mother, Uncle B, and Uncle C.    - We already know Alice's mother has **4 children (Alice, her 2 sisters, and a brother)**.    - Therefore, Uncle B and Uncle C together have **2 children** (because 6 total nephews and nieces minus the 4 from Alice's mother equals 2).     3. **Father's Side of the Family**:    - Alice's father has:      - **1 brother (Uncle D)** who has **2 daughters** and **4 nephews and nieces**.    - The **4 nephews and nieces** are the children of Uncle D's siblings. Since only Alice's father is mentioned as his sibling, these are Alice and her siblings\u2014confirming Alice's father has **4 children** (matching the earlier information).     4. **Calculating the Number of Cousins**:    - Cousins are the children of one's aunts and uncles.    - From Alice's mother's side:      - **2 cousins** (children of Uncle B and Uncle C).    - From Alice's father's side:      - **2 cousins** (daughters of Uncle D).    - **Total cousins**: \\(2 + 2 = 4\\).  ### Answer: 4",
