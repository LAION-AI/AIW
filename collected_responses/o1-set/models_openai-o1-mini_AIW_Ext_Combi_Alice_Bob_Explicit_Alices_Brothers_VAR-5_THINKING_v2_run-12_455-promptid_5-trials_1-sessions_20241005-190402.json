        "model_response":"Let's break down the problem step by step to ensure accuracy:  1. **Identify the Siblings:**    - Alice and Bob are siblings.    - Alice has 2 sisters.    - Bob has 3 brothers.  2. **Determine the Total Number of Sisters:**    - If Alice has 2 sisters, including herself, there are typically 3 sisters in total (Alice + 2 sisters). However, since the problem specifies that Alice has 2 sisters, it implies there are 3 girls in the family: Alice and her 2 sisters.  3. **Determine the Total Number of Brothers:**    - Bob has 3 brothers. This means there are 4 boys in total (Bob + 3 brothers).  4. **Understand Family Composition:**    - The family consists of:      - 3 sisters (including Alice)      - 4 brothers (including Bob)  5. **Answer the Question:**    - The question asks, \"How many brothers does Alice have?\"    - Since there are 4 brothers in total, Alice has **4 brothers**.  ### Answer: 4",
