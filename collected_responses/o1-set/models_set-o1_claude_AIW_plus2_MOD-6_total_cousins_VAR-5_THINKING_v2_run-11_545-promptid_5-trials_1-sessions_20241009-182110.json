Counting Alice's sister's cousins:    * From Alice's mother's side:      - Alice's mother's brothers do not have any children mentioned in the problem.      - So, there are no cousins from Alice's mother's side.    * From Alice's father's side:      - Alice's father's brother has 1 son, who is a cousin to Alice and her siblings.      - Alice's father has 2 sisters, but the problem does not mention if they have any children.      - So, there is at least 1 cousin from Alice's father's side.  Double-checking the solution: * The problem does not provide information about the children of Alice's father's sisters. * Therefore, we can only determine that Alice's sister has at least 1 cousin from her father's side.  ### Answer: Alice's sister has at least 1 cousin.",

This means that Alice's sister (let's call her Sister A) has 1 sister (Alice) and 1 brother.  2. Alice's mother has 2 brothers. These brothers are Sister A's uncles. We don't know if they have any children, so we can't count any cousins from this side yet.  3. Alice's mother also has 1 sister who does not have children. This aunt has 2 nephews and 4 nieces in total. Since this aunt doesn't have children, these nephews and nieces must come from her siblings (Alice's mother and her 2 brothers). We already know that Alice has 1 brother and 2 sisters, so these must be the 2 nephews and 2 of the nieces. The other 2 nieces must belong to Alice's uncles.  4. Alice's father has 2 sisters. These sisters are Sister A's aunts. We don't know if they have any children, so we can't count any cousins from this side yet.  5. Alice's father also has a brother who has 1 nephew and 4 nieces in total, and who also has 1 son. The 1 son is Sister A's cousin. The 1 nephew must be Alice's brother, and the 4 nieces must be Alice and her sisters (including Sister A).  Double-checking the path: - Sister A has 1 confirmed cousin from her father's side (the son of her father's brother). - We don't have enough information to determine if Sister A has any cousins from her mother's side or from her father's sisters.  Therefore, based on the given information, we can only confirm that Sister A has at least 1 cousin.  ### Answer: 1",

Alice's father's side:    - 2 sisters    - 1 brother    The brother has 1 nephew and 4 nieces, plus 1 son of his own.  4. Calculating Alice's cousins:    - From mother's side: 2 brothers, let's assume each has at least 1 child (to make up the 2 nephews and 4 nieces mentioned for the childless aunt). So at least 2 cousins.    - From father's side: 2 sisters (unknown number of children) and 1 brother with 1 son. So at least 1 cousin.  5. The total number of Alice's cousins is at least 3 (2 from mother's side + 1 from father's side).  6. Since the question asks about Alice's sister's cousins, we need to remember that Alice's siblings would have the same cousins as Alice.  Double-checking: - The information about Alice's mother's childless sister and father's brother's children helps confirm our calculation but doesn't add extra cousins. - We don't have exact information about how many children Alice's aunts and uncles have, except for her father's brother who has 1 son. - The minimum number of cousins that satisfies all the given information is 3.
