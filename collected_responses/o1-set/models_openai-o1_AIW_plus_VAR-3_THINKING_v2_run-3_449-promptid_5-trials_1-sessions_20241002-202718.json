Since the sister has no children, these come from her 2 brothers.    - Therefore, Alice's maternal uncles (her mother's brothers) have **7 children in total**.    - So, on the maternal side, Alice and her siblings have **7 cousins**.  3. **Paternal Side:**    - Alice's **father has a brother** who has:      - **5 nephews and nieces**.      - **1 son** (Alice's cousin).    - The **5 nephews and nieces** are the children of this brother's siblings.
