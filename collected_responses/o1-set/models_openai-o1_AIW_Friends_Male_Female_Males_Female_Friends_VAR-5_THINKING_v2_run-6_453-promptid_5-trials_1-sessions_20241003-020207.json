        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's carefully consider the relationships:  - Alice has **5 friends** in total: **2 males (M1 and M2)** and **3 females (F1, F2, F3)**.    - **All** of these friends are friends with **each other** and have **no other friends** outside this group. Additionally, **Alice is included** in the group that is all mutual friends.  - This means there are **6 people** in total (Alice + her 5 friends), and they form a **complete network** where everyone is friends with everyone else.  Now, focusing on **one male friend** (let's say M1):  - M1's friends are:   - **Alice** (who is female)   - **M2** (the other male friend)   - **F1, F2, and F3** (the three female friends)  - Thus, M1 has a total of **5 friends**:   - **1 male** (M2)   - **4 females** (Alice, F1, F2, F3)  Therefore, any male friend of Alice has **4 female friends** in this group.  ### Answer: 4",
