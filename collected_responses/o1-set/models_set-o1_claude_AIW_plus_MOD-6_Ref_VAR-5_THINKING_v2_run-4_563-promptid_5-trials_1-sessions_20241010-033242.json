        "model_response":"Okay, let's think through this step by step:  1. Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother. This means that Alice's siblings have the same number of cousins as Alice does.  2. Alice's mother has 2 brothers. The children of these brothers are Alice's cousins. However, we don't know how many children each of these brothers has.  3. Alice's mother also has 1 sister who does not have children. This sister has 6 nephews and nieces in total. These nephews and nieces are the children of Alice's mother's brothers (from step 2). So, the 2 brothers have 6 children in total, and these children are Alice's cousins.  4. Alice's father has 2 sisters. The children of these sisters are also Alice's cousins. However, we don't know how many children each of these sisters has.  5. Alice's father also has a brother who has 5 nephews and nieces in total. These nephews and nieces are the children of Alice's father's sisters (from step 4). So, the 2 sisters have 5 children in total, and these children are Alice's cousins.  6. The brother of Alice's father also has 1 son. This son is also Alice's cousin.  7. In total, Alice has 6 cousins from her mother's side (step 3) and 6 cousins from her father's side (5 from step 5 and 1 from step 6). So, Alice has 12 cousins in total.  8.
