        "model_response":"To determine the number of cousins Alice's sister has, let's break down the information step by step:  1. **Alice's Siblings:**    - Alice has **3 sisters**, making a total of **4 daughters** (including Alice).  2. **Mother's Side:**    - **Mother's Siblings:**      - **1 sister** (maternal aunt) who has **no children**.      - **2 brothers**.    - The maternal aunt has **6 nephews and nieces**. Since she has no children, these nephews and nieces are the children of her 2 brothers.    - **Cousins from Mother's Side:** **6**  3. **Father's Side:**    - **Father's Siblings:**      - **1 brother** (paternal uncle).    - The paternal uncle has:      - **5 nephews and nieces**. These are Alice and her siblings.      - **1 son**.    - Since Alice and her siblings account for **5 nephews and nieces**, and the uncle has **1 son**, there is **1 additional cousin** from the father's side.    - **Cousins from Father's Side:** **1**  4. **Total Cousins:**    - **6 (from mother's side) + 1 (from father's side) = 7**  ### Answer: 7",
