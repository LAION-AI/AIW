So, F1, F2, M1, M2, M3, and M4 all are mutual friends. - **No Other Friends**: Alice's friends do not have any other friends outside this group.  Now, consider one of Alice's male friends, say **M1**. His friends would be:  1. F1 (female) 2. F2 (female) 3. M2 (male) 4. M3 (male) 5. M4 (male) 6. Alice  However, since we are only asked about his **female friends**, M1 has **2 female friends** (F1 and F2).  So, each male friend of Alice has **2 female friends**.  ### Answer: 2",
