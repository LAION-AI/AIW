        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of siblings in the family and how they relate to Alice and Bob.  **Given:** - Alice and Bob are sister and brother, meaning they are siblings from the same family. - **Alice has 1 sister.** This implies that besides herself, there is one other sister. Therefore, there are **2 sisters** in total. - **Bob has 4 brothers.** This means that besides himself, there are four other brothers. Therefore, there are **5 brothers** in total.  **Total siblings in the family:** - **Sisters:** 2 - **Brothers:** 5 - **Total children:** 2 (sisters) + 5 (brothers) = **7 children**.  Since Alice is one of the sisters, the number of brothers she has is equal to the total number of brothers in the family. Therefore, **Alice has 5 brothers**.  ### Answer: 5",
