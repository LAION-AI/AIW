        "model_response":"To determine the number of cousins Alice's sister has, let's break down the information step by step:  1. **Alice's Immediate Family:**    - Alice has **2 sisters**, making a total of **3 daughters** in her immediate family.  2. **Mother's Side:**    - **Mother's Siblings:**      - **1 sister (maternal aunt)** who has **no children**.      - **2 brothers** (including Alice's father).    - **Nephews and Nieces from Mother's Siblings:**      - The maternal aunt has **6 nephews and nieces** in total.      - Since the aunt has no children, these nephews and nieces must come from her 2 brothers:        - **3 children** from Alice's mother (Alice and her 2 sisters).        - **3 children** from the other brother.    - **Cousins from Mother's Side:** **3** (children from the other brother).  3. **Father's Side:**    - **Father's Siblings:**      - **1 brother (paternal uncle)** who has **2 daughters**.    - **Nephews and Nieces from Father's Siblings:**      - The paternal uncle has **5 nephews and nieces** in total.      - The 2 daughters are part of these 5, so there are **3 additional cousins** from other siblings (assuming the father has another sibling, such as a sister with 3 children).    - **Cousins from Father's Side:** **5** (2 daughters from the uncle and 3 from another sibling).  4. **Total Cousins:**    - **From Mother's Side:** 3 cousins.    - **From Father's Side:** 5 cousins.    - **Total Cousins:** **3 + 5 = 8**.  After reconsidering the calculation, it's clear that the total number of cousins should be:  - **From Mother's Side:** 6 (3 from each brother). - **From Father's Side:** 5.  Thus, the correct total number of cousins is **11**.  ### Answer: 11",

Therefore, **the mother's brothers have 6 children** who are Alice's cousins.  3. **Father's Side:**    - **Father's Sibling:**      - 1 brother (Uncle) who has **2 daughters**.      - This Uncle also has **5 nephews and nieces** in total. These nephews and nieces include Alice and her sisters (3) and possibly other siblings (assuming Alice might have additional brothers to make up the count).    - However, since we're focusing on cousins, the **Uncle's 2 daughters are Alice's cousins**.  4. **Total Cousins:**    - From the **mother's side**: 6 cousins.    - From the **father's side**: 2 cousins.    - **Total cousins**: 6 (mother) + 2 (father) = **8 cousins**.  ### Answer: 8",
