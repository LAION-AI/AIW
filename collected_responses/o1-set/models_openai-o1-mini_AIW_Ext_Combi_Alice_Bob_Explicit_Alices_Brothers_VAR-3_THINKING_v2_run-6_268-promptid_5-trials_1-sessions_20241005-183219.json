This means there are **2 sisters** in total (Alice and her sister).  3. **Bob's Siblings:**    - Bob has **4 brothers**. This typically means Bob has 4 **additional brothers** besides himself, making it **5 brothers** in total (including Bob).  4. **Alice's Brothers:**    - Since Bob is one of Alice's brothers and there are 4 other brothers (as per Bob's count), Alice has a total of **5 brothers**.  ### Answer: 5",
