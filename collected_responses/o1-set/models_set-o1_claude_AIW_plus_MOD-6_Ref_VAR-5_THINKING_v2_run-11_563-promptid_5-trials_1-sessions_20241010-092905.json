Alice's mother also has 1 sister who does not have children but has 6 nephews and nieces.    - Since this aunt doesn't have children, these 6 nephews and nieces must be from her other siblings (Alice's mother and her brothers).    - Alice and her 3 siblings account for 4 of these 6 nephews and nieces.    - The remaining 2 nephews and nieces must be from Alice's maternal uncles, meaning Alice has 2 cousins from her mother's side.  4.

Since this sister doesn't have children of her own, these 6 nephews and nieces must be the children of Alice's mother and her 2 brothers.

        "model_response":"Let's break this down step by step:  1. Alice's immediate family:    - Alice    - 2 sisters    - 1 brother    Total: 4 children  2. Alice's mother's side:    - 2 brothers (Alice's uncles)    - 1 sister (Alice's aunt) with no children  3. Alice's father's side:    - 2 sisters (Alice's aunts)    - 1 brother (Alice's uncle) who has 1 son  4. Counting cousins:    - From mother's side:      * 2 uncles, but we don't know how many children they have    - From father's side:      * 2 aunts, but we don't know how many children they have      * 1 uncle who has 1 son  5. Important information:    - Alice's mother's sister (aunt) has 6 nephews and nieces in total    - Alice's father's brother (uncle) has 5 nephews and nieces in total  6. Deduction:    - The 6 nephews and nieces of Alice's aunt on her mother's side must be:      Alice + her 2 sisters + her brother = 4      Plus 2 more from the other uncle (6 - 4 = 2)    - The 5 nephews and nieces of Alice's uncle on her father's side are:      Alice + her 2 sisters + her brother = 4      Plus his own son = 5  7. Conclusion:    - From mother's side: 2 cousins    - From father's side: 1 cousin (the son of Alice's uncle)  8. Total cousins: 2 + 1 = 3  Double-checking: - We've accounted for all known children - The numbers match with the given information about nephews and nieces - We haven't made any assumptions about unknown children  ### Answer: 3",

        "model_response":"Let's think through this step-by-step:  1. First, let's identify Alice's siblings:    - Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother  2. Now, let's look at Alice's mother's side:    - Her mother has 2 brothers    - Her mother has 1 sister (Alice's aunt) who doesn't have children  3. On Alice's father's side:    - Her father has 2 sisters    - Her father has 1 brother who has 1 son  4. To find Alice's sister's cousins, we need to count the children of Alice's aunts and uncles, excluding Alice and her siblings:     On mother's side:    - We know Alice's aunt has no children    - We don't know if the 2 uncles have children or how many     On father's side:    - We know one uncle has 1 son    - We don't know if the 2 aunts have children or how many  5. The key information is:    - Alice's mother's sister (aunt) has 6 nephews and nieces in total    - Alice's father's brother (uncle) has 5 nephews and nieces in total  6. Let's break this down:    - The 6 nephews and nieces of Alice's aunt include Alice, her 2 sisters, and her brother (4 in total)    - This means the other 2 must be cousins from Alice's mother's brothers     - The 5 nephews and nieces of Alice's father's brother include Alice, her 2 sisters, and her brother (4 in total)    - We know this uncle has 1 son, so there are no additional cousins from this uncle  7. Therefore, Alice's sister's cousins are:    - 2 from mother's side (her uncles' children)    - 1 from father's side (her uncle's son)  8.
