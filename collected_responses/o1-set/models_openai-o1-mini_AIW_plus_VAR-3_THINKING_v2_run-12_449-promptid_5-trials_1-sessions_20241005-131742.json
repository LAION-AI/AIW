        "model_response":"Let's break down the problem step by step to determine how many cousins Alice's sister has.  1. **Alice's Family:**    - Alice has 3 sisters, making a total of 4 children in her immediate family.  2. **Mother's Side:**    - Alice's mother has 1 sister (maternal aunt) who does not have children.    - This maternal aunt has 7 nephews and nieces. Since she has no children, these nephews and nieces must be the children of her 2 brothers (Alice's maternal uncles).    - Therefore, from the mother's side, there are **7 cousins**.  3. **Father's Side:**    - Alice's father has 1 brother (paternal uncle).    - This paternal uncle has 5 nephews and nieces.    - These nephews and nieces are the children of his siblings, which are Alice and her 3 sisters.    - Therefore, from the father's side, there are **5 cousins**.  4. **Total Cousins:**    - Adding both sides together: 7 (mother's side) + 5 (father's side) = **12 cousins**.  ### Answer: 12",
