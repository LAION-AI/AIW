These are the children of her siblings (since she has no children).      - Since Alice's mother has 5 children (Alice and her sisters), the 2 brothers must have 1 child in total (because 5 [from Alice's mother] + 1 [from the brothers] = 6 nephews and nieces).    - **Conclusion**: On her mother's side, Alice and her sisters have **1 cousin**.  3. **Paternal Side**:    - **Alice's Father** has 1 brother.    - The brother has 5 nephews and nieces.

        "model_response":"To determine how many cousins Alice's sister has, let's break down the family relationships step by step:  1. **Alice's Immediate Family:**    - Alice has 4 sisters. So, Alice's parents have 5 children (Alice + 4 sisters). There is no mention of any brothers, so we will assume there are none.  2. **Father's Side:**    - Alice's father (let's call him F) has a brother (FB) who has **5 nephews and nieces**.      - The nephews and nieces of FB are the children of his siblings. Since only F is mentioned as FB's sibling, these nephews and nieces must be F's children.      - Therefore, F has 5 children, which matches with Alice and her 4 sisters.    - FB also has **1 son**.      - So, on her father's side, Alice's sister has **1 cousin** (FB's son).  3. **Mother's Side:**    - Alice's mother (let's call her M) has:      - 1 sister (S1) who **does not have children** and has **6 nephews and nieces**.      - 2 brothers (B1 and B2).    - The nephews and nieces of S1 are the children of her siblings (M, B1, and B2).      - Since S1 has 6 nephews and nieces and M has 5 children (Alice and her 4 sisters), B1 and B2 must have **1 child** between them.    - So, on her mother's side, Alice's sister has **1 cousin** (the child of either B1 or B2).  **Total Cousins:** - Father's side: 1 cousin - Mother's side: 1 cousin - **Total cousins**: 1 + 1 = **2**  ### Answer: 2",
