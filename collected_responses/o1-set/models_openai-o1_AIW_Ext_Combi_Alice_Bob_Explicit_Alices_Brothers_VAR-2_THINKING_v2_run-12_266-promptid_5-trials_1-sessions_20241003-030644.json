        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's break down the information step by step.  1. **Alice and Bob are sister and brother**, implying they are siblings.     2. **Alice has 2 sisters**:    - Since we're talking about Alice's sisters excluding herself, this indicates there are **3 girls in total** (Alice + 2 sisters).  3. **Bob has 2 brothers**:    - Similarly, Bob's brothers are excluding himself, so there are **3 boys in total** (Bob + 2 brothers).  4. **Total children in the family**:    - **3 girls + 3 boys = 6 children**.  5. **Alice's brothers**:    - Alice has **3 brothers**: Bob and his 2 brothers.    - Since Bob's 2 brothers are also Alice's brothers, and Bob himself is her brother, Alice has **3 brothers in total**.  ### Answer: 3",
