        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's carefully analyze the given information step by step:  1. **People in the Group:**    - **Alice**    - **5 female friends**: We'll call them F1, F2, F3, F4, F5.    - **3 male friends**: We'll call them M1, M2, M3.    - Total people: 1 (Alice) + 5 (female friends) + 3 (male friends) = **9 people**.  2. **Friendship Relations:**    - \"They all are friends with each other and have no other friends aside.\" This means:      - **Every person in this group is friends with every other person**.      - The social network forms a **complete graph** where each of the 9 people is connected to the other 8 people.  3. **Determining the Number of Female Friends for a Male Friend:**    - Let's consider one of the male friends, say **M1**.    - **M1's friends in the group are:**      - **Alice** (female)      - **The 5 female friends (F1-F5)** (female)      - **The other 2 male friends (M2 & M3)** (male)    - Therefore, **total friends of M1**: 1 (Alice) + 5 (female friends) + 2 (male friends) = **8 friends**.    - **Number of female friends M1 has:**      - **Alice** (female)      - **5 female friends (F1-F5)** (female)      - Total female friends: **1 (Alice) + 5 = 6 female friends**.  **Conclusion:** Each male friend of Alice has **6 female friends** in this group: Alice herself and the 5 female friends.  ### Answer: 6",

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:  1. **Total People Involved**: Alice has:    - 5 female friends    - 3 male friends    - Including herself, that's a total of **9 people** (1 Alice + 5 females + 3 males).  2. **Friendship Network**:    - **\"They all are friends with each other\"** implies that every person is friends with every other person in the group. So, it's a complete network where each person has 8 friends (since there are 9 people total).  3. **Analyzing a Male Friend's Connections**:    - A male friend (let's pick any one of the 3 male friends) is friends with:      - The **5 female friends**.      - **Alice** herself.      - The other **2 male friends**.    - So, in terms of **female friends**, the male friend is friends with:      - **5 female friends + Alice** = **6 female friends**.  **Therefore, each male friend of Alice has 6 female friends.**  ### Answer: 6",
