        "model_response":"Let's solve this problem step by step:  1. Alice has 1 sister and 1 brother, which means her sister has 1 brother (Alice's brother).  2. Alice's mother has 2 brothers. Their children will be Alice's sister's cousins.  3. Alice's mother's sister has no children, so she does not contribute to the number of cousins.  4. Alice's father has 2 sisters. Their children will also be Alice's sister's cousins.  5. Alice's father has a brother who has 1 daughter. This daughter is Alice's sister's cousin.  Now, let's count the total number of cousins:  1. Alice's mother's brothers' children: We don't know the exact number, but we know that Alice's mother's sister has 2 nephews and 4 nieces in total. Since Alice's mother's sister has no children, these 6 nephews and nieces must be the children of Alice's mother's 2 brothers. So, there are 6 cousins from this side of the family.  2. Alice's father's sisters' children: We don't have information about the number of children they have, so we cannot count them.  3. Alice's father's brother's daughter: She is 1 cousin.  Therefore, the minimum number of cousins Alice's sister has is 7 (6 from her mother's side and 1 from her father's side).

        "model_response":"Let's think through this step by step:  1. First, we need to identify who Alice's cousins are. Cousins are the children of her aunts and uncles.  2. From Alice's mother's side:    - Her mother has 2 brothers    - Her mother has 1 sister, but this sister doesn't have children  3. From Alice's father's side:    - Her father has 2 sisters    - Her father has 1 brother, who has 1 daughter  4. Now, let's count the cousins:    - From mother's side: We don't know if the 2 brothers have children, so we can't count any cousins from here.    - From father's side: We know his brother has 1 daughter, so that's 1 cousin.    - We don't know if the father's 2 sisters have children, so we can't count any cousins from them.  5. The question asks about Alice's sister's cousins. Since Alice and her sister share the same parents, they have the same cousins.  6. Double-checking:    - We're only certain about 1 cousin (the daughter of Alice's father's brother).    - The information about nephews and nieces doesn't help us determine the number of cousins.    - We don't have enough information about the children of Alice's other aunts and uncles.  Therefore, based on the information given, we can only be certain of one cousin.  ### Answer: 1",

        "model_response":"Let's think through this step-by-step:  1. We need to count Alice's cousins, which would be the same as Alice's sister's cousins.  2. Cousins come from aunts and uncles, so we need to look at Alice's parents' siblings.  3. From Alice's mother's side:    - Her mother has 2 brothers    - Her mother has 1 sister, but this sister has no children  4. From Alice's father's side:    - Her father has 2 sisters    - Her father has 1 brother  5. Now, let's count the children of these aunts and uncles:    - Mother's 2 brothers: We don't have information about their children    - Mother's sister: No children    - Father's 2 sisters: We don't have information about their children    - Father's brother: Has 1 daughter  6. The only cousin we can confirm is the daughter of Alice's father's brother.  7. Double-checking:    - We're told that Alice's father's brother has 3 nephews and 2 nieces in total.    - This matches with Alice (1 niece), Alice's sister (1 niece), and Alice's brother (1 nephew).    - The other 2 nephews must be from Alice's father's sisters' children, but we can't count these as we don't know if they're Alice's first cousins or more distant relatives.  8. Therefore, we can only confirm one cousin for Alice's sister.  ### Answer: 1",
