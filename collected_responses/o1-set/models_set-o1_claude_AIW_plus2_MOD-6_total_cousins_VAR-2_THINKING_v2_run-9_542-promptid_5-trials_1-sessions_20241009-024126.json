Now, let's count the cousins:    - From mother's side: We don't know if the 2 brothers have children, so we can't count any cousins from here.    - From father's side: We know his brother has 1 son, so that's 1 cousin.  5. We're told that Alice's father's brother has 1 nephew and 3 nieces in total. This nephew and these nieces are Alice, her sisters, and her brother:    - Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother (4 in total, matching the 1 nephew and 3 nieces)  6. We're also told that Alice's mother's sister (who doesn't have children) has 2 nephews and 4 nieces in total. This further confirms that Alice, her siblings, and her 1 cousin (son of her father's brother) are all the children in this generation of the family:    - 2 nephews (Alice's brother and her male cousin)    - 4 nieces (Alice and her 2 sisters, plus potentially a female cousin we didn't know about before)  7.

        "model_response":"Okay, let's think through this problem step by step:  1. Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother. This means that Alice's sister (let's call her Sister A) has 1 sister (Alice) and 1 brother.  2. Alice's mother has 2 brothers. These brothers are Alice and Sister A's uncles. We don't know if these uncles have children or not.  3. Alice's mother also has 1 sister who does not have children. This aunt has 2 nephews and 4 nieces in total. These nephews and nieces are the children of Alice's mother's brothers (from step 2). They are cousins to Alice and Sister A.  4. Alice's father has 2 sisters. These sisters are Alice and Sister A's aunts. We don't know if these aunts have children or not.  5. Alice's father also has a brother who has 1 nephew and 3 nieces in total, and who also has 1 son. The nephew and nieces are the children of Alice's father's sisters (from step 4). They are cousins to Alice and Sister A. The son is also a cousin to Alice and Sister A.  Now, let's count the total number of cousins for Sister A:  - From step 3, Sister A has 2 nephews and 4 nieces from her mother's side. Total: 6 cousins. - From step 5, Sister A has 1 nephew, 3 nieces, and 1 cousin (the son) from her father's side. Total: 5 cousins.  Therefore, Sister A has a total of 6 + 5 = 11 cousins.  Let's double-check the path to the solution: - We correctly identified the siblings of Alice and Sister A. - We correctly identified the uncles and aunts from both sides of the family. - We correctly counted the cousins from the mother's side and the father's side.  The solution appears to be correct.  ### Answer: Alice's sister has 11 cousins.",

        "model_response":"Let's think through this step by step:  1. Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother, which means she has 3 siblings in total.  2. Alice's mother has 2 brothers. The children of these brothers would be Alice's cousins. However, we don't know how many children they have.  3. Alice's mother also has 1 sister who does not have children. This sister has 2 nephews and 4 nieces in total. These nephews and nieces are Alice's cousins. So, from Alice's mother's side, she has 6 cousins (2 nephews + 4 nieces).  4. Alice's father has 2 sisters. The children of these sisters would be Alice's cousins. However, we don't know how many children they have.  5. Alice's father also has a brother who has 1 nephew and 3 nieces, and 1 son of his own. The nephew and nieces are Alice's cousins, but the son is not (he is the cousin of Alice's father, making him Alice's uncle). So, from Alice's father's side, she has 4 cousins (1 nephew + 3 nieces).  6. In total, Alice has 10 cousins that we know of (6 from her mother's side + 4 from her father's side). However, there could be more cousins from the children of Alice's mother's brothers and Alice's father's sisters, but we don't have that information.  7. The question asks about Alice's sister's cousins. Alice's siblings have the same cousins as Alice.
