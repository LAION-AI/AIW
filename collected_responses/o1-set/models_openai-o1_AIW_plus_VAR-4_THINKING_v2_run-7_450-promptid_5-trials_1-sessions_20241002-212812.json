        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's carefully construct Alice's family tree:  1. **Alice's Immediate Family**:    - Alice has 4 sisters, so there are 5 daughters in total.    - There is no mention of any brothers.  2. **Maternal Side (Mother's Side)**:    - Alice's mother has:      - 1 sister (Aunt) who **does not have children**.      - 2 brothers.    - The aunt has 6 nephews and nieces. Since she has no children, these must be the children of her siblings.      - Alice's mother has 5 daughters (Alice and her sisters).      - Therefore, the 2 brothers combined have **1 child** (because 6 nephews and nieces minus the 5 nieces from Alice's family equals 1).  3. **Paternal Side (Father's Side)**:    - Alice's father has:      - 1 brother who has **1 son**.      - This brother has 5 nephews and nieces, who are Alice and her 4 sisters (since there is no mention of other siblings on the father's side).  4. **Total Cousins Alice's Sister Has**:    - From the maternal side: **1 cousin** (the child of the mother's brothers).    - From the paternal side: **1 cousin** (the son of the father's brother).    - **Total cousins**: 1 (maternal) + 1 (paternal) = **2 cousins**.  ### Answer: 2",

        "model_response":"To determine how many cousins Alice's sister has, let's carefully reconstruct the family tree based on the provided information.  1. **Alice's Immediate Family:**    - Alice has **4 sisters**, so there are **5** daughters in total in Alice's immediate family (including herself).    - The possibility of Alice having brothers is not mentioned explicitly but is crucial to consider due to the total number of nieces and nephews referenced later.  2. **Mother's Side:**    - Alice's mother has:      - **1 sister** who **does not have children**.      - This sister has **6 nephews and nieces**.      - She also has **2 brothers**.    - Since the sister (Alice's aunt) doesn't have children, her **6 nephews and nieces** must be the children of her siblings: Alice's mother and her two brothers.    - Alice's mother has at least **5 children** (Alice and her 4 sisters), which suggests that:      - **Option 1:** Alice's mother has **6 children** (including a son), and her brothers have no children.      - **Option 2:** Alice's mother has **5 children**, and her brothers have **1 child** between them.    - Given the limited information, it's logical to assume that Alice's mother has **5 children**, and the uncles have **1 child**. So, Alice has **1 cousin** on her mother's side.  3. **Father's Side:**    - Alice's father has a brother who:      - Has **1 son** (Alice's cousin).      - Has **5 nephews and nieces**.    - The brother's **5 nephews and nieces** are likely Alice and her siblings.    - There's no mention of additional siblings from Alice's father's side, so it's reasonable to conclude that Alice has **1 cousin** on her father's side.  4. **Conclusion:**    - **Total cousins** Alice's sister has = **1 (mother's side) + 1 (father's side) = 2 cousins**.  ### Answer: 2",
