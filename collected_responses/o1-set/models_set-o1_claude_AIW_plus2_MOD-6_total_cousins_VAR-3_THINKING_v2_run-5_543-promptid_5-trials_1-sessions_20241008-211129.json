From Alice's father's side:    - Her father has 2 sisters    - Her father has 1 brother, who has 1 son  4. Now, let's count the cousins:    - From mother's side: We don't know if the 2 brothers have children, so we can't count any cousins from here.    - From father's side: We know his brother has 1 son, so that's 1 cousin.    - We don't have information about children of Alice's father's sisters.  5.

First, we need to identify Alice's aunts and uncles:    - From her mother's side: 2 uncles and 1 aunt    - From her father's side: 2 aunts and 1 uncle  2. Now, let's look at the information about children:    - Mother's side:      - The aunt has no children      - We don't have information about the uncles' children    - Father's side:      - One uncle has 1 son      - We don't have information about the aunts' children  3. We know that Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother, so that's 3 siblings in total.  4. The information about nephews and nieces:    - Mother's sister has 3 nephews and 4 nieces    - Father's brother has 1 nephew and 4 nieces  5. Let's consider the nephews and nieces of the mother's sister:    - 3 nephews + 4 nieces = 7 total    - This matches exactly with Alice (1) + her siblings (3) + her father's brother's son (1) = 5    - The remaining 2 must be cousins from her mother's side (children of her mother's brothers)  6. Now, let's look at the father's brother's nephews and nieces:    - 1 nephew + 4 nieces = 5 total    - This matches exactly with Alice (1) + her siblings (3) + his own son (1) = 5    - This means there are no additional cousins from the father's side  7. In total, Alice's cousins are:    - 2 from her mother's side    - 1 from her father's side (her father's brother's son)  Therefore, Alice has 3 cousins in total. Since the question asks about Alice's sister's cousins, and siblings share the same cousins, the answer is the same for Alice's sister.  ### Answer: 3",

We're not given direct information about the children of the other aunts and uncles, but we can deduce some information:    - Mother's sister has 3 nephews and 4 nieces in total    - Father's brother has 1 nephew and 4 nieces in total  4.
