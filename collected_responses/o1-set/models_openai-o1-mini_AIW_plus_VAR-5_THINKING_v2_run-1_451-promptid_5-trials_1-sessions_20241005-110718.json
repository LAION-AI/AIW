Since she has no children, these must be the children of her 2 brothers.    - **Cousins from Mother's Side:** 6  3. **Father's Side:**    - Father has 1 brother (Uncle).    - Uncle has 1 son.    - Uncle has 5 nephews and nieces. These are the children of his siblings, which in this case are Alice and her 3 sisters.    - **Cousins from Father's Side:** 1 (Uncle's son) + 5 (nephews and nieces) = 6  **Total Cousins:** - **From Mother's Side:** 6 - **From Father's Side:** 5 (since the uncle's son is an additional cousin beyond Alice and her sisters) - **Total Cousins:** 6 + 5 = 11  ### Answer: 11",

        "model_response":"Let's break down the problem step by step to determine how many cousins Alice's sister has.  **1. Alice's Immediate Family:** - Alice has 3 sisters. Therefore, there are 4 sisters in total.  **2. Mother's Side:** - **Aunt M (Mother's Sister):**   - She does not have any children.   - She has 6 nephews and nieces. Since Aunt M has no children, these nephews and nieces must be the children of her brothers.   - She also has 2 brothers.    - **Uncle M1 and Uncle M2 (Mother's Brothers):**   - Together, they have 6 children (Alice's cousins from the mother's side).  **3. Father's Side:** - **Uncle F (Father's Brother):**   - He has 5 nephews and nieces.   - He also has 1 son.    - **Understanding Uncle F's Nephews and Nieces:**   - The nephews and nieces of Uncle F would be the children of his siblings. Assuming Uncle F has only one sibling (the father), the 5 nephews and nieces would be Alice and her 3 sisters, plus possibly an additional sibling not mentioned directly in the problem.   - The son mentioned is Uncle F's own child, which is not a cousin to Alice's sister but rather her aunt\/uncle's child.  **4. Calculating Total Cousins:** - **From Mother's Side:** 6 cousins. - **From Father's Side:** 5 cousins.  **Total Cousins:** 6 (mother's side) + 5 (father's side) = **11 cousins**  ### Answer: 11",
