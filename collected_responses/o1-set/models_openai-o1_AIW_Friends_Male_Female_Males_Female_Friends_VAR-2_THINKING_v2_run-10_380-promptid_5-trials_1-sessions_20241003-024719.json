        "model_response":"To solve the problem step by step:  1. **Clarify the group**: Alice has a total of 6 friends\u20142 female friends and 4 male friends. Including Alice herself, there are 7 people in this group.  2. **Understand their relationships**: The statement \"They all are friends with each other and have no other friends aside\" means that every person in this group is friends with every other person, and they don't have friends outside this group.  3. **Focus on a male friend**: Pick any one of Alice's male friends (since the relationships are symmetrical, it doesn't matter which one).  4. **Count his female friends**:    - He is friends with Alice (female).    - He is friends with the 2 other female friends.    - Therefore, he has **3 female friends**.  ### Answer: 3",
