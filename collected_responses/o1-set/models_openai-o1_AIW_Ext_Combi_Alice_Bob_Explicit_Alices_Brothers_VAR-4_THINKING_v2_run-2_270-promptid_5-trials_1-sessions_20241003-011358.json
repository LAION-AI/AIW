Including Alice herself, there are a total of 4 sisters in the family (Alice + 3 sisters).  3. **Bob has 1 brother**. Including Bob himself, this means there are a total of 2 brothers in the family (Bob + 1 brother).  4. Therefore, the siblings in the family consist of **4 sisters** and **2 brothers**, making a total of 6 children.  5. Since **Alice is one of the sisters**, the number of brothers she has is equal to the number of boys in the family, which is **2** (Bob and his brother).  ### Answer: 2",

So, besides Bob, there is 1 other brother. Therefore, the total number of boys in the family is \\(1 (Bob) + 1 = 2\\) boys.  4. **Total children in the family**: Adding up the boys and girls, there are \\(4 (girls) + 2 (boys) = 6\\) children in total.  5. **Brothers of Alice**: Since Alice is one of the 6 children, her brothers are the boys in the family.
