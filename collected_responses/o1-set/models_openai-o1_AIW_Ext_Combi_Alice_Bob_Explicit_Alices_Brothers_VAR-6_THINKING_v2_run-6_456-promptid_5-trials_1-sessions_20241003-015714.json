        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's analyze and visualize the family setup step by step.  1. **Understand the family structure:**    - Alice and Bob are sister and brother, so they are siblings in the same family.    - Alice has **3 sisters**. This means there are 3 other girls besides Alice. Therefore, the **total number of girls** (sisters) is **4** (Alice + 3 sisters).    - Bob has **5 brothers**. This means there are 5 other boys besides Bob. Therefore, the **total number of boys** (brothers) is **6** (Bob + 5 brothers).  2. **Total number of siblings:**    - Total siblings = Total sisters + Total brothers = 4 (sisters) + 6 (brothers) = **10 siblings**.  3. **Determine the number of brothers Alice has:**    - Since Alice is one of the 4 sisters, her brothers are all the boys in the family.    - Therefore, Alice has **6 brothers**.  ### Answer: 6",
