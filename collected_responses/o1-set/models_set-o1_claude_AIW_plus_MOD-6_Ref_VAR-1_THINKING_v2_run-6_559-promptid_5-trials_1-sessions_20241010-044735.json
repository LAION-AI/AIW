These are Alice's sister's uncles. We don't know if they have children or not.  3. Alice's mother also has 1 sister who doesn't have children. This sister has 6 nephews and nieces in total. These could be from Alice's mother's side or father's side. We can't determine how many of these are Alice's sister's cousins yet.  4. Alice's father has 2 sisters. These are Alice's sister's aunts.

Step 1: Determine the number of cousins from Alice's mother's side. - Alice's mother has 2 brothers, so their children will be Alice's cousins. - The total number of nephews and nieces of Alice's mother's sister is 6, which includes Alice, her sister, and her brother. - So, the number of cousins from Alice's mother's brothers is: 6 - 3 = 3  Step 2: Determine the number of cousins from Alice's father's side. - Alice's father has 2 sisters, so their children will be Alice's cousins. - Alice's father's brother has 2 sons, who are also Alice's cousins. - The total number of nephews and nieces of Alice's father's brother is 5, which includes his own 2 sons and the children of his sisters. - So, the number of cousins from Alice's father's sisters is: 5 - 2 = 3  Step 3: Calculate the total number of cousins Alice's sister has. - Alice's sister has the same number of cousins as Alice. - Total number of cousins = Cousins from mother's side + Cousins from father's side - Total number of cousins = 3 + 3 = 6  Double-checking the solution: - The given information and the calculated number of cousins from each side are consistent. - The total number of cousins is the sum of cousins from both sides, which is correct.  ### Answer: Alice's sister has 6 cousins.",

        "model_response":"To determine the number of cousins Alice's sister has, let's break down the information step by step:  1. **Alice's Immediate Family:**    - **Siblings:** Alice has 1 sister and 1 brother, making a total of 3 children in her immediate family.  2. **Uncles and Aunts:**    - **Maternal Side:** Alice's mother has 2 brothers (maternal uncles).    - **Paternal Side:** Alice's father has 2 sisters (paternal aunts) and 1 brother (paternal uncle).  3. **Children from Immediate Siblings:**    - **Sister:** Alice's sister does not have children but has 6 nephews and nieces, which must come from Alice and her brother.    - **Paternal Uncle's Information:** The paternal uncle has 5 nephews and nieces and also has 2 sons.  4. **Reconciling the Information:**    - From the sister's perspective: Alice and her brother have a total of 6 children (since the sister has 6 nephews and nieces).    - From the paternal uncle's perspective: Alice and her brother have 5 children (since he has 5 nephews and nieces).    - This discrepancy suggests that Alice's brother has 5 children, aligning with the paternal uncle's count, while Alice likely has 1 child, making the total 6.  5. **Cousins of Alice's Sister:**    - **Children of Uncles and Aunts:**      - **Paternal Uncle:** Has 2 sons.      - **Maternal Uncles and Paternal Aunts:** No additional children are mentioned.    - Therefore, the only cousins are the 2 sons from the paternal uncle.  **Final Answer:**  ### Answer: 2",

        "model_response":"Let's think through this step by step:  1. First, let's focus on Alice's mother's side:    - Alice's mother has 2 brothers    - Alice's mother has 1 sister (who has no children)    - The sister has 6 nephews and nieces in total  2. Now, let's look at Alice's father's side:    - Alice's father has 2 sisters    - Alice's father has 1 brother    - This brother has 2 sons    - This brother has 5 nephews and nieces in total  3. Let's count Alice's siblings:    - Alice has 1 sister and 1 brother  4. To find Alice's sister's cousins, we need to count the children of Alice's aunts and uncles:        From mother's side:    - 2 uncles: We don't know how many children they have, but we know the total    - The childless aunt doesn't contribute to the cousin count     From father's side:    - 2 aunts: We don't know how many children they have    - 1 uncle: We know he has 2 sons  5. We can deduce the number of cousins from the mother's side:    - The childless aunt has 6 nephews and nieces    - These are: Alice, her sister, her brother, and 3 cousins from the 2 uncles  6. We can deduce the number of cousins from the father's side:    - The uncle has 5 nephews and nieces    - These are: Alice, her sister, her brother, and 2 more (his own sons)    - So there are no additional cousins from this uncle    - We don't know about any children from the 2 aunts  7. Summing up the cousins:    - 3 cousins from mother's side    - 2 cousins from father's side (the uncle's sons)    - Unknown number from father's 2 sisters  Therefore, we can confidently say that Alice's sister has at least 5 cousins.  ### Answer: At least 5",

        "model_response":"Let's think through this step-by-step:  1. First, let's identify Alice's immediate family:    - Alice has 1 sister and 1 brother    - So, Alice's parents have 3 children in total  2. Now, let's look at Alice's mother's side:    - Alice's mother has 2 brothers    - Alice's mother has 1 sister with no children    - The sister has 6 nephews and nieces in total  3. Let's examine Alice's father's side:    - Alice's father has 2 sisters    - Alice's father has 1 brother    - This brother has 2 sons    - This brother has 5 nephews and nieces in total  4. To find Alice's sister's cousins, we need to count the children of Alice's aunts and uncles:     From mother's side:    - 2 uncles: We don't know how many children they have     From father's side:    - 2 aunts: We don't know how many children they have    - 1 uncle: We know he has 2 sons  5. The key information is that Alice's father's brother has 5 nephews and nieces in total:    - We know 3 of these are Alice and her siblings    - So, the remaining 2 must be children of Alice's father's sisters  6. Therefore, we can conclude:    - Alice's father's sisters have 2 children in total    - Alice's father's brother has 2 sons    - Alice's mother's brothers have 3 children in total (to make up the 6 nephews and nieces mentioned for Alice's mother's sister)  7. Adding these up:    2 (father's sisters' children) + 2 (father's brother's sons) + 3 (mother's brothers' children) = 7  8. Double-checking: This matches with the information about Alice's mother's sister having 6 nephews and nieces (3 from Alice's family and 3 from her brothers).  Therefore, Alice's sister has 7 cousins.  ### Answer: 7",

The 6 nephews and nieces of Alice's aunt include Alice, her sister, and her brother (3 in total). This means the other 3 must be cousins from Alice's mother's brothers.  8.
