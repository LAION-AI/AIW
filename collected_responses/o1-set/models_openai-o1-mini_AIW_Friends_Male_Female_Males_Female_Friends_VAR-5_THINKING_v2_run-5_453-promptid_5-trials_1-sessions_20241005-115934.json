        "model_response":"Let's analyze the problem step by step:  1. **Alice's Friends**:    - Alice has a total of 5 friends: 2 male and 3 female.  2. **Mutual Friendships**:    - All of Alice's friends are friends with each other. This means:      - Each male friend is friends with both female friends and the other male friend.      - Each female friend is friends with both male friends and the other female friends.  3. **Considering a Male Friend of Alice**:    - Let's select one of Alice's male friends.    - This male friend is friends with:      - Alice (female).      - The other male friend.      - All 3 female friends.  4. **Counting Female Friends**:    - **Including Alice**: The male friend has 4 female friends (Alice + 3 female friends).    - **Excluding Alice**: The male friend has 3 female friends.     Since the question asks for the number of female friends a male friend has **aside from Alice**, the correct count is 3.  ### Answer: 3",
