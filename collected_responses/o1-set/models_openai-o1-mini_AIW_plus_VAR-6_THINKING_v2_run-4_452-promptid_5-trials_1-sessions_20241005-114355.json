        "model_response":"To determine how many cousins Alice's sister has, let's break down the information step by step:  1. **Alice's Immediate Family:**    - Alice has **2 sisters**, making a total of **3 siblings** (Alice plus two sisters).  2. **Mother's Side:**    - **Mother's Sister:** Has **6 nephews and nieces**, but **no children** of her own. This implies that the **6 children** are from the mother's **brothers**.    - **Mother's Brothers:** There are **2 brothers** who together have **6 children**. These 6 children are Alice's **cousins** from the mother's side.  3. **Father's Side:**    - **Father's Brother:** Has **4 nephews and nieces** in total. These nephews and nieces are Alice and her siblings.    - **Children on Father's Side:** Since the father's brother has **4 nephews and nieces**, it implies that Alice's father has **4 children** in total. Given that Alice has **2 sisters**, there must be **1 additional sibling**, likely a brother.    - **Father's Brother's Own Children:** Additionally, the father's brother has **2 daughters**, but these are Alice's cousins, separate from the nephews and nieces mentioned.  4. **Total Cousins:**    - From the **mother's side**: **6 cousins**.    - From the **father's side**: **4 cousins**.    - **Total**: **6 + 4 = 10 cousins**.  Therefore, Alice's sister has **10 cousins**.  ### Answer: 10",

Mother's Side:** - **Mother's Siblings:** Alice's mother has 1 sister (a maternal aunt) and 2 brothers (maternal uncles). - **Maternal Aunt:** She does not have children. - **Maternal Uncles:** Together, they have 6 nephews and nieces. Since the maternal aunt has no children, all 6 are Alice's cousins from her mother's brothers.  **3. Father's Side:** - **Father's Sibling:** Alice's father has 1 brother (a paternal uncle). - **Paternal Uncle's Children:** He has 2 daughters. - **Nephews and Nieces:** The paternal uncle has a total of 4 nephews and nieces. These are Alice and her 2 sisters, plus one more child, but since Alice only has 2 sisters, it implies there might be another sibling or a miscount. However, based on given information, we'll consider it as 4 cousins from the father's side.  **4. Total Cousins:** - **From Mother's Side:** 6 cousins - **From Father's Side:** 4 cousins - **Total:** 6 + 4 = 10 cousins  ### Answer: 10",
