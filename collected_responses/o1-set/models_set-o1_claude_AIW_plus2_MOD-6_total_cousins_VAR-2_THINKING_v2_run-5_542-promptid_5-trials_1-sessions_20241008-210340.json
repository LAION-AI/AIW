        "model_response":"Let's solve this problem step by step:  1. Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother in total, which means her parents have 4 children (including Alice).  2. Alice's mother has 2 brothers:    - We don't know if these brothers have children or not.  3. Alice's mother has 1 sister who does not have children:    - This sister has 2 nephews and 4 nieces in total.    - These nieces and nephews are the children of Alice's mother's brothers (from step 2).  4.
