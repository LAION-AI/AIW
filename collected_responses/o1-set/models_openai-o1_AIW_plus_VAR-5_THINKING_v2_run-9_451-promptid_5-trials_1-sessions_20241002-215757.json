Mother's Side:** - Alice's mother has:   - 1 sister who has no children.   - 2 brothers (Uncle1 and Uncle2). - The aunt (mother's sister who has no children) has 6 nephews and nieces. These are the children of her siblings (Alice's mother and her two brothers). - Since Alice's mother has 4 daughters, the two uncles (Uncle1 and Uncle2) must have 6 - 4 = **2 children** between them. - Therefore, on the mother's side, Alice's sister has **2 cousins**.  **3. Father's Side:** - Alice's father has:   - 1 brother (UncleX) who has 1 son.   - An implied additional sibling (SiblingX) because UncleX has 5 nephews and nieces. - UncleX has 5 nephews and nieces, which include Alice and her 3 sisters (4 nieces) and the child of SiblingX. - Therefore, SiblingX must have 1 child. - On the father's side, Alice's sister has UncleX's son and SiblingX's child as cousins, totaling **2 cousins**.  **4.
