        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's carefully dissect the information given:  1. **Alice has 8 male friends.** Since Bob is male and they're friends, Bob is one of these 8 male friends. 2. **Bob has 7 female friends.** Since Alice is female and they're friends, Alice is one of these 7 female friends. 3. **All mentioned persons are friends with each other and have no other friends aside.** This means every person in this group is friends with everyone else in the group, and there are no other friends outside this group.  From the above, we can deduce:  - **Total males in the group:** 8 males (including Bob). - **Total females in the group:** 7 females (including Alice). - **Total people in the group:** 8 males + 7 females = **15 people**.  Since Alice is friends with everyone except herself, the number of her female friends is:  - **Total females in the group** minus **herself**: - \\( 7 \\text{ (total females)} - 1 \\text{ (Alice herself)} = 6 \\).  ### Answer: 6",
