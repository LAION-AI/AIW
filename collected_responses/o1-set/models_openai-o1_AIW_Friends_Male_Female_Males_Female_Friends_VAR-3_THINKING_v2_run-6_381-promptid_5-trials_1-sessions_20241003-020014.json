        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's carefully break down the information provided:  1. **Alice's Friends**: Alice has 4 female friends (let's call them F1, F2, F3, F4) and 1 male friend (M).  2. **Friendship among Friends**: All of Alice's friends are friends with each other. This means:    - F1 is friends with F2, F3, F4, and M.    - F2 is friends with F1, F3, F4, and M.    - F3 is friends with F1, F2, F4, and M.    - F4 is friends with F1, F2, F3, and M.    - M is friends with F1, F2, F3, and F4.  3. **No Other Friends**: Alice's friends have no other friends aside from each other. This implies that Alice herself is not considered in their friend group (since otherwise, they would have another friend, Alice).  4. **Question**: How many female friends does the male friend (M) have?     Since M is friends with F1, F2, F3, and F4 (the 4 female friends), and they have no other friends, M has **4 female friends**.  ### Answer: 4",
