This implies that the other siblings (including Alice) have a total of 6 children.  3. **Maternal Side:**    - **Mother's Brothers (Maternal Uncles):** Alice's mother has 2 brothers. However, there's no information about whether they have children.  4. **Paternal Side:**    - **Father's Sisters (Paternal Aunts):** Alice's father has 2 sisters.    - **Father's Brother (Paternal Uncle):** He has 1 brother who:      - Has **4 nephews and nieces** (which coincide with Alice and her 3 siblings).      - Has **1 son**.  5. **Cousins Count:**    - **From the Paternal Uncle:** The only explicitly mentioned cousin is the paternal uncle's **1 son**.    - **From Other Aunts and Uncles:** There's no information provided about children from the other maternal uncles or paternal aunts. Hence, we assume they have no children or their children aren't considered in this context.  **Conclusion:** The only confirmed cousin of Alice's sister is the paternal uncle's son.  ### Answer: 1",

On Alice's father's side:    - Father has 2 sisters    - Father has 1 brother who has 4 nephews and nieces, and 1 son  4.

Therefore, we cannot derive any additional information about cousins from the nephew and niece counts.  8. We can only confirm one cousin: the son of Alice's paternal uncle.

Alice's family:    - Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother.    - So, including Alice, there are 4 siblings in her immediate family.  2. Alice's mother's side:    - Alice's mother has 2 brothers.    - She also has 1 sister who does not have children.    - This sister has 6 nephews and nieces in total.    - Since Alice's mother has 4 children, the remaining 2 nephews and nieces must be from her 2 brothers.  3. Alice's father's side:    - Alice's father has 2 sisters.    - He also has a brother who has 4 nephews and nieces in total, and who also has 1 son.    - Since the brother has 1 son, the remaining 3 nephews and nieces must be from Alice's father's 2 sisters.  4. Counting Alice's cousins:    - From Alice's mother's side, there are 2 cousins (nephews and nieces of Alice's mother's sister).    - From Alice's father's side, there are 3 cousins (nephews and nieces of Alice's father's brother).    - Additionally, Alice's father's brother has 1 son, who is also Alice's cousin.    - In total, Alice has 2 + 3 + 1 = 6 cousins.  5. Alice's sister's cousins:    - Since Alice and her siblings share the same parents, they have the same cousins.    - Therefore, Alice's sister also has 6 cousins.  Double-checking the solution: - The total number of nephews and nieces on Alice's mother's side (6) matches the given information. - The total number of nephews and nieces on Alice's father's side (4) matches the given information. - All the relationships and numbers are accounted for, and the final answer is consistent with the problem statement.  ### Answer: Alice's sister has 6 cousins.",

        "model_response":"Let's think through this problem step by step:  1. Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother. This means Alice's siblings are not relevant for counting her sister's cousins.  2. Alice's mother has 2 brothers. The children of these brothers will be Alice's sister's cousins.  3. Alice's mother also has 1 sister who does not have children. Since this sister doesn't have children, she doesn't contribute to the number of Alice's sister's cousins.  4. The sister of Alice's mother has 6 nephews and nieces in total. These nephews and nieces are the children of Alice's mother's brothers, and they are Alice's sister's cousins.  5. Alice's father has 2 sisters. The children of these sisters will also be Alice's sister's cousins.  6. Alice's father has a brother who has 4 nephews and nieces in total. These nephews and nieces are Alice's sister's cousins.  7. Alice's father's brother also has 1 son. This son is also Alice's sister's cousin.  Now, let's sum up the cousins: - From Alice's mother's side: 6 cousins (nephews and nieces of Alice's mother's sister) - From Alice's father's side: 4 cousins (nephews and nieces of Alice's father's brother) + 1 cousin (son of Alice's father's brother) = 5 cousins  Therefore, the total number of cousins Alice's sister has is 6 + 5 = 11.  Double-checking the result: - The total number of cousins is determined by the number of children of Alice's mother's brothers and Alice's father's siblings. - We have correctly counted the children of each relevant family member. - The final sum of 11 cousins appears to be correct.  ### Answer: Alice's sister has 11 cousins.",
