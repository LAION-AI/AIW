        "model_response":"To determine how many cousins Alice's sister has, let's break down the information step by step:  1. **Alice's Siblings:**    - Alice has 2 sisters, making a total of 3 sisters including herself.  2. **Mother's Side:**    - **Siblings of Alice's Mother:**      - 1 sister (maternal aunt) who has no children.      - 2 brothers.    - **Cousins from Mother's Side:**      - The 2 brothers have children totaling 6 nephews and nieces. These are Alice's cousins.  3. **Father's Side:**    - **Siblings of Alice's Father:**      - 1 brother (paternal uncle).    - **Cousins from Father's Side:**      - The paternal uncle has 2 daughters.      - He also has a total of 5 nephews and nieces. Since Alice and her 2 sisters are part of this count (3 children), the remaining 2 are his daughters.      - Therefore, there are 2 cousins from the paternal uncle.  4. **Total Cousins:**    - From Mother's Side: 6 cousins.    - From Father's Side: 2 cousins.    - **Total:** 6 + 2 = **8 cousins**.  ### Answer: 8",

Therefore, these nephews and nieces come from the mother's brothers.      - **2 brothers (Uncle M1 and Uncle M2):** Together, they have **3 children** (since Aunt A's 6 nephews and nieces include Alice and her 2 sisters).  3. **Father's Side:**    - **Father's Sibling:**      - **1 brother (Uncle F):** He has **2 daughters** and **5 nephews and nieces**.      - The **5 nephews and nieces** come from the father's side children. Since the immediate family has **3 daughters** (Alice and her sisters), it implies that there might be additional children from the father's side or an inconsistency in the numbers provided. However, based on the information given, we consider that Uncle F's **2 daughters** are the primary contributors to the cousins from the father's side.  4. **Total Cousins:**    - **From Mother's Side:** **3 cousins** (children of Uncle M1 and Uncle M2).    - **From Father's Side:** **2 cousins** (daughters of Uncle F).
