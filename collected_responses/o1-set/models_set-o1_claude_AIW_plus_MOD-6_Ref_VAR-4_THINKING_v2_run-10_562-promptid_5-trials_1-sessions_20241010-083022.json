These are the children of Alice and her 3 brothers, meaning Alice and her brothers have a total of 6 children.  3. **Parents' Siblings:**    - **Mother's Side:** Alice's mother has 2 brothers (maternal uncles). No information is provided about their children.    - **Father's Side:**       - Alice's father has 2 sisters and 1 brother (paternal uncle).      - The paternal uncle has 1 daughter.       - The same uncle reports having 5 nephews and nieces, which aligns with the 5 children from Alice and her 3 brothers (assuming one sibling hasn't had children yet or there's a discrepancy in the count).  4. **Cousins:**    - The only explicitly mentioned cousin is the 1 daughter of Alice's paternal uncle.    - There's no information provided about children from the maternal uncles or paternal aunts.  **Conclusion:** Based on the provided information, the only confirmed cousin is the 1 daughter of the paternal uncle.  ### Answer: 1",

The problem doesn't specify if they have children, so we'll assume they do not contribute to the cousin count.    - **Paternal Side:**      - **Father's Sisters:** Alice's father has 2 sisters (paternal aunts). Similarly, no information is provided about their children, so they are not counted as sources of cousins.      - **Father's Brother:** Alice's father has 1 brother (paternal uncle) who has:        - **1 Daughter:** This is one cousin for Alice's sister.        - **5 Nephews and Nieces:** These are Alice's siblings' children. Since Alice's sister doesn't have children herself, all nephews and nieces come from the brothers' families.  3. **Total Cousins Calculation:**    - **From Brothers:** 5 nephews and nieces from the 3 brothers.    - **From Paternal Uncle:** 1 daughter.

        "model_response":"Let's think through this step-by-step:  1. First, let's identify Alice's siblings:    - Alice has 1 sister and 3 brothers    - This means there are 5 children in Alice's family (including Alice)  2. Now, let's look at Alice's mother's side:    - Her mother has 2 brothers    - Her mother has 1 sister with no children    - The sister has 6 nephews and nieces in total  3. Next, Alice's father's side:    - Her father has 2 sisters    - Her father has 1 brother    - This brother has 5 nephews and nieces in total    - This brother has 1 daughter  4. To find Alice's sister's cousins, we need to count the children of Alice's aunts and uncles:    - Mother's side:       * 2 uncles, but we don't know how many children they have    - Father's side:      * 2 aunts, but we don't know how many children they have      * 1 uncle with 1 daughter  5. The key information is in the nephews and nieces:    - Mother's sister has 6 nephews and nieces    - Father's brother has 5 nephews and nieces  6. We know there are 5 children in Alice's family, so:    - The 6 nephews and nieces on mother's side must include Alice and her siblings (5) plus 1 more    - The 5 nephews and nieces on father's side must be Alice and her siblings  7. Therefore:    - Mother's brothers have 1 child in total    - Father's brother has 1 daughter    - We still don't know about father's sisters' children  8. Counting the cousins:    - 1 from mother's side    - 1 from father's brother  So, Alice's sister has 2 cousins that we can confirm from the given information.  ### Answer: 2",

From Alice's father's side:    - Her father has 2 sisters    - Her father has 1 brother with 1 daughter  4. To find Alice's sister's cousins, we need to count the children of Alice's aunts and uncles:    - Mother's 2 brothers: We don't know how many children they have    - Mother's sister: No children    - Father's 2 sisters: We don't know how many children they have    - Father's brother: 1 daughter  5. We're given some additional information:    - Mother's sister (who has no children) has 6 nephews and nieces    - Father's brother has 5 nephews and nieces  6. Let's use this information:    - The 6 nephews and nieces of mother's sister must be Alice and her 4 siblings, plus 1 more    - This extra 1 must be a child of one of mother's brothers    - The 5 nephews and nieces of father's brother must be Alice and her 4 siblings  7.
