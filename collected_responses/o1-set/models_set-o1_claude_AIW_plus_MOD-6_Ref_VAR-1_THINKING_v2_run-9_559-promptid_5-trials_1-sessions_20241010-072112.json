Since the aunt is childless, her 6 nephews and nieces must be the children of her siblings (Alice's mother and her 2 brothers). Alice's mother has 3 children (Alice, her sister, and her brother). Therefore, the two uncles must have a total of 3 children combined to reach a total of 6 nephews and nieces.  So, on the maternal side, Alice's cousins are the 3 children of her uncles.  **Paternal Side:** - **Alice's Father** has:   - 1 brother (who has 2 sons)   - 2 sisters  The father's brother has 5 nephews and nieces in total. These are the children of his siblings (Alice's father and his 2 sisters). Since Alice's father has 3 children (Alice, her sister, and her brother), the two aunts must have a total of 2 children combined to reach a total of 5 nephews and nieces.  So, on the paternal side, Alice's cousins are the 2 sons of her uncle and the 2 children of her aunts, totaling 4 cousins.  **Combining Both Sides:** - **Total Maternal Cousins:** 3 - **Total Paternal Cousins:** 4 - **Total Cousins:** 3 (maternal) + 4 (paternal) = **7 cousins**  ### Answer: 7",
