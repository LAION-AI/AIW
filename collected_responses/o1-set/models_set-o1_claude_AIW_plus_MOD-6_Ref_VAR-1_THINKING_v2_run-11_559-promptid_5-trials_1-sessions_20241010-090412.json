We know that 2 of these are his own sons, so the remaining 3 must be Alice, her sister, and her brother.  Now, let's count the total number of cousins Alice's sister has: - From Alice's mother's side: 3 cousins (children of Alice's mother's brothers) - From Alice's father's side: The children of Alice's father's 2 sisters  We don't know the exact number of children Alice's father's sisters have, but we can deduce that it must be 3. Here's why: - Alice's father's brother has 5 nephews and nieces in total, and 3 of them are Alice, her sister, and her brother. - The remaining 2 must be the children of Alice's father's 2 sisters. - Since we're told Alice's father has 2 sisters, and there are 2 remaining nephews\/nieces unaccounted for, each of these sisters must have 1 child.  So, the total number of cousins Alice's sister has is: - 3 from Alice's mother's side - 2 from Alice's father's side (1 from each of Alice's father's sisters)  Double-checking the solution, there don't appear to be any mistakes in the reasoning.  ### Answer: Alice's sister has 5 cousins in total.",
