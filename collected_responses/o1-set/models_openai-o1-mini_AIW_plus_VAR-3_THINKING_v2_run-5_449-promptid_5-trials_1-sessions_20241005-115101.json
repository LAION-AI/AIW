        "model_response":"To determine how many cousins Alice's sister has, let's break down the information step by step:  1. **Alice's Immediate Family:**    - **Alice and Her Sisters:** Alice has 3 sisters, making a total of 4 siblings.  2. **Mother's Side:**    - **Mother's Siblings:** Alice's mother has 1 sister (who does not have children) and 2 brothers.    - **Nephews and Nieces from Mother's Side:** The mother's sister has 7 nephews and nieces. Since the mother's sister doesn't have children, these nephews and nieces must come from the mother's other siblings.      - **Mother's Children:** 4 (Alice and her 3 sisters).      - **Mother's Brothers' Children:** 3 (since 4 Alice-related children + 3 from father's side could total 7, but for clarity, we're focusing on cross-sides).  3. **Father's Side:**    - **Father's Siblings:** Alice's father has 1 brother.    - **Nephews and Nieces from Father's Side:** The father's brother has 5 nephews and nieces.      - **Father's Children:** 4 (Alice and her 3 sisters).      - **Children from Father's Brother:** 1 son.  4. **Total Cousins:**    - **From Mother's Side:** 7 cousins.    - **From Father's Side:** 5 cousins.    - **Total Cousins:** 7 (mother's side) + 5 (father's side) = 12 cousins.  ### Answer: 12",
