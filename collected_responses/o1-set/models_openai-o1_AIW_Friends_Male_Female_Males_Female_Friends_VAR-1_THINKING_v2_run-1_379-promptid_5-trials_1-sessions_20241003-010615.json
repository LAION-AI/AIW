        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we need to carefully consider the relationships between the people involved.  Let's list out the people:  - **Alice** - **3 male friends** (let's call them M1, M2, M3) - **6 female friends** (let's call them F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, F6)  Given: - They all are friends with each other. - They have no other friends besides these.  Now, focusing on any one male friend (e.g., M1), let's determine the number of his female friends.  Since they all are friends with each other: - M1 is friends with:   - **Alice** (female)   - **6 female friends** (F1 to F6)   - **2 other male friends** (M2 and M3)  So, the total number of female friends M1 has is: - **Alice** + **6 female friends** = **7 female friends**  ### Answer: 7",
