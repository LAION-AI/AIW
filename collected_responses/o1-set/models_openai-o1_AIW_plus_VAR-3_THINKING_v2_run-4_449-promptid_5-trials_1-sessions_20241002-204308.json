        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we need to carefully build Alice's family tree and count her siblings' cousins, who are also Alice's cousins. Here are the steps:  **1. Alice's Immediate Family:** - Alice has **3 sisters**, so there are **4 siblings** in Alice's immediate family (Alice + 3 sisters).  **2. Maternal Side:** - Alice's mother has:   - **1 sister** who **does not have children**.   - **2 brothers**. - Alice's mother has **7 nephews and nieces**. Since her sister has no children, these nephews and nieces come from her **2 brothers**.   - Therefore, Alice's mother's brothers have **7 children** in total. - These **7 children** are **Alice's and her sisters' maternal cousins**.  **3. Paternal Side:** - Alice's father has a **brother** (let's call him Uncle U) who has:   - **1 son** (Alice's cousin).   - **5 nephews and nieces** in total, which are the children of his siblings. - Since Alice's father's brother has **5 nephews and nieces** and Alice's father has **4 daughters**, the missing nephew\/niece must come from **another sibling** of Alice's father.   - Therefore, Alice's father must have **another sibling** (likely a sister) who has **1 child**. - Together, Alice's father's siblings have **5 nephews and nieces** (Alice and her sisters + the child of the other sibling). - So, on the paternal side, Alice has **2 cousins** (Uncle U's son and the child of the other sibling).  **4.
