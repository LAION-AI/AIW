        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's carefully consider the family's composition.  1. **Alice and Bob are sister and brother**, meaning they share the same parents and are siblings.  2. **Alice has 3 sisters**. Since this counts only her sisters (excluding herself), there are 3 other girls in the family besides Alice.  3. **Bob has 1 brother**. This counts only his brother (excluding himself), so there is 1 other boy in the family besides Bob.  4. **Total siblings**:    - **Sisters**: Alice + 3 sisters = 4 girls    - **Brothers**: Bob + 1 brother = 2 boys  5. **Total children in the family**: 4 girls + 2 boys = **6 children**.  6. **Alice's brothers**: Since Alice and Bob are siblings, the two boys (Bob and his brother) are both Alice's brothers.  ### Answer: 2",

So, let's list the siblings:  - **Sisters**:   - **Alice**   - Sister 1   - Sister 2   - Sister 3  - **Brothers**:   - **Bob**   - Brother 1  From the above, we can see:  - **Total sisters**: 4 (including Alice) - **Total brothers**: 2 (including Bob)  Therefore, **Alice has 2 brothers**: Bob and Brother 1.  ### Answer: 2",

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we'll carefully step through the information given:  1. **Alice and Bob are siblings**: Alice is a sister, and Bob is a brother.     2. **Alice has 3 sisters**: This means there are 3 sisters *in addition* to Alice herself. So, the total number of sisters is 4 (Alice plus her 3 sisters).  3. **Bob has 1 brother**: This means there is 1 brother *in addition* to Bob himself. So, the total number of brothers is 2 (Bob plus his brother).  4. **Total siblings in the family**: Adding the total sisters and brothers together, we get 4 sisters + 2 brothers = **6 children** in the family.  5. **Counting Alice's brothers**: Since Alice is one of the 4 sisters, the remaining siblings are her brothers. Therefore, Alice has **2 brothers** (Bob and his brother).  ### Answer: 2",
