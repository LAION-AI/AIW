        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of cousins Alice's sister has. This involves deducing the number of children in Alice's extended family.  1. **From the father's side:**    - Alice's father has one brother who has one son.    - The uncle has 5 nephews and nieces.    - Since the uncle's nephews and nieces are his sibling's children and he has only one sibling (Alice's father), Alice's father must have 5 children.    - Alice has 3 sisters and must have **1 brother** (since 3 sisters + Alice + 1 brother = 5 children).  2. **From the mother's side:**    - Alice's mother has one sister (who has no children) and two brothers.    - The aunt has 6 nephews and nieces.    - These nephews and nieces are the children of her siblings (Alice's mother and the two brothers).    - Alice's mother has 5 children (Alice, 3 sisters, and 1 brother).    - Therefore, the two brothers together have **1 child** (since 5 children from Alice's mother + 1 child from the uncles = 6 nephews and nieces).  3. **Total cousins Alice's sister has:**    - From the father's side: **1 cousin** (the son of the uncle).    - From the mother's side: **1 cousin** (the child of the uncles).    - **Total cousins = 1 + 1 = 2.**  ### Answer: 2",

Let's break it down step by step:  **Alice's Immediate Family:** - Alice has **3 sisters**, so Alice's parents have **4 daughters in total** (including Alice). - We have no information about any brothers, so we'll assume there are no other children.  **Mother's Side:** - Alice's mother has:   - **1 sister** who **does not have children**.   - **2 brothers**. - The sister has **6 nephews and nieces**, who are the children of her siblings (since she has no children). - Alice's mother has **4 daughters**, so the **2 brothers must have a total of 2 children** (since 4 + 2 = 6). - Therefore, on her mother's side, Alice's sister has **2 cousins** (children of her uncles).  **Father's Side:** - Alice's father has:   - **1 brother** who has **1 son**.   - The brother has **5 nephews and nieces**, who are the children of his siblings. - Alice's parents have **4 children**, so there must be **another sibling** of Alice's father who has **1 child** (since 4 + 1 = 5). - Therefore, on her father's side, Alice's sister has **2 cousins** (one from the uncle with a son and one from the other sibling).  **Total Cousins:** - **Mother's side cousins**: 2 - **Father's side cousins**: 2 - **Total cousins**: \\(2 + 2 = 4\\)  ### Answer: 4",
