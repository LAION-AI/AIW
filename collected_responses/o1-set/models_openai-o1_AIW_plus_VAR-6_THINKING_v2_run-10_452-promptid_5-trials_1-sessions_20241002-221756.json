        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step and build Alice's family tree based on the information given.  1. **Alice's Immediate Family**:    - Alice has 2 sisters. Therefore, Alice's parents have at least 3 children (Alice and her 2 sisters).    - However, we learn later that Alice's father has 4 children because his brother has 4 nephews and nieces. Since Alice's father has only one sibling (his brother), these 4 nephews and nieces must be Alice's father's children. Therefore, Alice has another sibling (totaling 4 children). So, Alice has 2 sisters and 1 additional sibling.  2. **Maternal Side**:    - Alice's mother has 1 sister (who is childless) and 2 brothers.    - The childless sister has 6 nephews and nieces. These are the children of her siblings (Alice's mother and her 2 brothers).    - Since Alice's mother has 4 children (Alice, her 2 sisters, and the additional sibling), the 2 maternal uncles must have 2 children between them (because 6 nephews and nieces minus the 4 children of Alice's mother equals 2).    - Therefore, on the maternal side, Alice's sister has **2 cousins**.  3. **Paternal Side**:    - Alice's father has 1 brother who has 2 daughters.    - This brother also has 4 nephews and nieces (Alice and her 3 siblings).    - Therefore, on the paternal side, Alice's sister has **2 cousins**.  4. **Total Cousins**:    - Maternal cousins: 2    - Paternal cousins: 2    - **Total cousins**: 2 + 2 = **4**  However, upon re-examination, we realize that Alice's father has 4 children, and Alice's mother has 3 children. This indicates an inconsistency in our earlier calculation. Correcting this:  - **Alice's Immediate Family**: Alice's parents have 4 children (Alice, 2 sisters, and 1 other sibling).  - **Maternal Side**:    - The childless sister has 6 nephews and nieces.    - Alice's mother has 4 children.    - Therefore, the 2 maternal uncles have 2 children between them (6 - 4 = 2).    - **Maternal cousins**: 2  - **Paternal Side**:    - Alice's father's brother has 2 daughters.    - **Paternal cousins**: 2  - **Total cousins**: 2 (maternal) + 2 (paternal) = **4**  Thus, Alice's sister has **4 cousins**.  ### Answer: 4",

        "model_response":"To determine the number of cousins Alice's sister has, let's break down the family relationships step by step.  **Alice's Immediate Family:** - Alice has **2 sisters**, so there are **3 daughters** in her immediate family.  **Maternal Side:** 1. Alice's mother has:    - **1 sister** (Alice's aunt) who **does not have children**.    - **2 brothers** (Alice's uncles).  2. The childless aunt has **6 nephews and nieces**. These are the children of her siblings:    - Alice's mother has **3 daughters** (Alice and her 2 sisters).    - Therefore, the **2 maternal uncles** must have a total of **3 children** (since 6 nephews and nieces minus 3 from Alice's family equals 3).  3. So, on the maternal side, Alice's sister has **3 cousins**.  **Paternal Side:** 1. Alice's father has:    - **1 brother** (Alice's uncle) who has:      - **2 daughters** (Alice's cousins).      - **4 nephews and nieces** (the children of his siblings).  2. Alice's father's brother (the uncle) has **4 nephews and nieces**. Since Alice's father has **3 daughters**, and the uncle has **4 nephews and nieces**, there must be at least one more sibling (let's call this person **Paternal Sibling 2** or PS2) who has **1 child** to account for the fourth nephew\/niece.  3. So, on the paternal side, Alice's sister has:    - **2 cousins** from the uncle.    - **1 cousin** from PS2.  4.
