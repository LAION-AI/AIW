        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's carefully analyze the given information:  1. **Alice has 2 female friends (F1 and F2) and 4 male friends (M1, M2, M3, M4).** 2. **They all are friends with each other and have no other friends aside.**  This means:  - Every person in this group is friends with everyone else in the group (including Alice). - There are no friendships outside this group.  Now, focusing on any male friend of Alice (let's choose M1 for clarity), let's determine how many female friends he has:  - **M1 is friends with:**   - **Alice** (since he is a friend of hers).   - **F1 and F2** (since all members are friends with each other).   - **Other male friends (M2, M3, M4)**.  - **Counting female friends:**   - **Alice** (female).   - **F1** (female).   - **F2** (female).  Therefore, **M1 has 3 female friends**.  ### Answer: 3",
