        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's start by analyzing the information step by step:  1. **Alice and Bob are siblings**: Specifically, Alice is a sister, and Bob is a brother.  2. **Alice has 2 sisters**: Since people don't count themselves when listing siblings, this means Alice has two sisters *in addition to herself*. Therefore, there are **3 girls** in total (Alice + 2 sisters).  3. **Bob has 2 brothers**: Similarly, Bob has two brothers *other than himself*. This means there are **3 boys** in total (Bob + 2 brothers).  4. **Total number of children**: Adding up the girls and boys, we have **3 girls + 3 boys = 6 children** in the family.  5. **Finding out how many brothers Alice has**: Since there are 3 boys in total, and Alice is not one of them, those 3 boys are all Alice's brothers. Therefore, **Alice has 3 brothers**.  ### Answer: 3",
