This means there are a total of 4 sisters in the family (including Alice).  3. **Bob's Siblings:**    - Bob has 5 brothers. Since Bob is one of the brothers, this means there are a total of 6 brothers in the family (including Bob).  4. **Determining Alice's Brothers:**    - Since Alice and Bob are siblings, all of Bob's brothers are also Alice's brothers.    - Bob has 5 brothers, so Alice has 5 brothers.  **Final Answer:**  ### Answer: 5",
