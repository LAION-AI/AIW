Now, let's look at Alice's mother's side:    - Her mother has 2 brothers    - Her mother has 1 sister (Alice's aunt) who has no children    - This aunt has 6 nephews and nieces in total  3. Let's examine Alice's father's side:    - Her father has 2 sisters    - Her father has 1 brother    - This uncle has 5 nephews and nieces in total    - This uncle has 1 daughter  4. To find Alice's sister's cousins, we need to count the children of Alice's aunts and uncles:    - From mother's side:       * 2 uncles, but we don't know how many children they have    - From father's side:      * 2 aunts, but we don't know how many children they have      * 1 uncle who has 1 daughter  5. The only cousin we can confirm is the 1 daughter of Alice's paternal uncle  6. We might be tempted to use the information about nephews and nieces, but this is a trap:    - The 6 nephews and nieces of Alice's maternal aunt include Alice and her siblings    - The 5 nephews and nieces of Alice's paternal uncle also likely include Alice and her siblings  7. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact number of cousins Alice's sister has based on the given information.

From Alice's mother's side:    - Her 2 brothers might have children, but we don't have specific information about them.    - Her sister has no children.  6. From Alice's father's side:    - We know his brother has 1 daughter. This is one confirmed cousin.    - We don't have specific information about his 2 sisters' children.  7.
