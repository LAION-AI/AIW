        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many sisters an individual brother of Alice has. Let's break down the family structure:  - Alice has 3 brothers. - Alice has 6 sisters. - Including Alice herself, there are 7 girls in total (Alice + 6 sisters). - There are 3 boys (the brothers).  Therefore, the total number of children in the family is 10 (7 girls + 3 boys).  From the perspective of one of the brothers, his sisters are all the girls in the family. This includes Alice and the 6 other sisters.  So, each brother has **7 sisters**.  ### Answer: 7",

This means there are a total of 7 sisters in the family (Alice + 6 sisters).  2. **Total Brothers in the Family**: Alice has 3 brothers.  3. **Total Children in the Family**: Combining the sisters and brothers, there are 7 sisters + 3 brothers = **10 children** in the family.  4. **Sisters of Alice's Brother**: We're asked how many sisters does one of Alice's brothers have. Each brother has all the sisters in the family as his sisters.     - **Sisters for the Brother**: Since there are 7 sisters (including Alice), each brother has **7 sisters**.  **Answer: 7**",
