Alice's mother has 4 daughters (Alice and her 3 sisters). Therefore, Uncle 1 and Uncle 2 have a total of 3 children (since 7 - 4 = 3).  **Paternal Side:** - Alice's paternal grandparents have at least 3 children:   - Alice's father   - Uncle (who has 1 son)   - Another sibling (who has 1 child)  The uncle has 5 nephews and nieces, which are the children of his siblings. Alice's father has 4 daughters, so there must be another sibling with 1 child (since 5 - 4 = 1).  **Total Cousins:** - On the maternal side: 3 cousins (children of Uncle 1 and Uncle 2) - On the paternal side: 2 cousins (1 son of the uncle and 1 child of the other sibling)    **Therefore, Alice's sister has a total of 3 + 2 = 5 cousins.**  ### Answer: 5",

This means that Alice's parents have at least 4 daughters. However, the problem doesn't state that Alice has no brothers. Given information later in the problem, it's implied there is at least one brother.  **Alice's Mother's Side:** - Alice's mother has:   - **1 sister** who does **not have children**.   - **2 brothers**. The total nephews and nieces her mother has are **7**. - Since the sister has no children, the **7 nephews and nieces** must be from the **2 brothers**. - Therefore, **Alice has 7 cousins on her mother's side**.  **Alice's Father's Side:** - Alice's father has **1 brother** (Alice's uncle). - This uncle has:   - **5 nephews and nieces in total**.   - **1 son** (Alice's cousin). - The uncle's nephews and nieces are the children of his siblings. Since only Alice's father is mentioned as his sibling, the **5 nephews and nieces must be Alice and her siblings**. - Given the uncle has **5 nephews and nieces** and we already know Alice has **3 sisters**, this implies **Alice has at least 1 brother** (since 4 sisters + 1 brother = 5 nieces and nephews). - Therefore, **Alice has 1 cousin on her father's side**.  **Total Cousins:** - **Mother's side:** 7 cousins. - **Father's side:** 1 cousin. - **Total:** 7 + 1 = **8 cousins**.  ### Answer: 8",
