        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's carefully analyze the given information:  - Alice has 2 female friends (let's call them F1 and F2). - Alice has 4 male friends (let's call them M1, M2, M3, and M4). - They all are friends with each other, and have no other friends besides this group. This implies that the group consists of Alice and her 6 friends, all of whom are friends with each other.  Now, let's focus on one of Alice's male friends, say M1.  M1's friends within this group are:  1. Alice (female) 2. F1 (female) 3. F2 (female) 4. M2 (male) 5. M3 (male) 6. M4 (male)  So, M1 has a total of 6 friends, among which there are 3 females: Alice, F1, and F2.  ### Answer: 3",
