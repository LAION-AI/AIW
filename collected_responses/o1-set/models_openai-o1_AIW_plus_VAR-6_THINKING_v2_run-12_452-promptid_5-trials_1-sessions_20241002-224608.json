        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we need to carefully reconstruct Alice's family tree step by step.  1. **Alice's Immediate Family:**    - Alice has **2 sisters**. So, Alice's parents have **3 daughters**: Alice and her sisters.  2. **Maternal Side:**    - Alice's **mother has 1 sister** (Aunt), who **does not have children**.    - This aunt has **6 nephews and nieces** and **2 brothers**.    - Therefore, Alice's mother has **3 siblings**: the childless sister (Aunt), **2 brothers**, and herself.    - The **6 nephews and nieces** are the children of these siblings (excluding the childless aunt).      - Alice's mother has **3 daughters** (Alice and her sisters).      - Therefore, the **2 brothers** have **3 children combined** (since \\(6 - 3 = 3\\)).    - **Maternal Cousins:** The children of Alice's maternal uncles are **3 cousins**.  3. **Paternal Side:**    - Alice's **father has a brother** (Uncle) who:      - Has **2 daughters**.      - Has **4 nephews and nieces in total**.    - The uncle's **4 nephews and nieces** come from his siblings' children.      - Alice and her sisters count as **3 nieces**.      - Since he has **4 nephews and nieces**, there must be **1 more nephew\/niece**.    - This implies that Alice's father has **another sibling** (Sibling) with **1 child**.    - **Paternal Cousins:** The uncle's **2 daughters** and the other sibling's **1 child** make **3 cousins**.  4. **Total Cousins:**    - **Maternal cousins:** **3**    - **Paternal cousins:** **3**    - **Total cousins:** \\(3 + 3 = 6\\)  Therefore, **Alice's sister has 6 cousins**.  ### Answer: 6",

Again, this includes Alice, her two sisters, and one brother.  **Counting Cousins for Alice's Sister:** - Cousins are the children of aunts and uncles (excluding her own siblings). - **Maternal cousins:** 2 (children of the two maternal uncles). - **Paternal cousins:** 2 (the two daughters of the paternal uncle). - **Total cousins:** 2 (maternal) + 2 (paternal) = **4 cousins**.  ### Answer: 4",
