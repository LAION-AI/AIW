        "model_response":"To determine the number of cousins Alice\u2019s sister has, let's methodically analyze the information provided.  1. **Alice\u2019s Immediate Family**:    - Alice has **3 sisters**.    - So, there are **4 daughters** in Alice\u2019s family.    - Since there's a possibility of additional siblings, the mention of nephews and nieces suggests Alice may also have **1 brother**.  2. **Maternal Side**:    - Alice's mother has:      - **1 sister** (who is childless).      - **2 brothers**.    - The childless aunt has **7 nephews and nieces**. These are the children of her siblings (Alice's mother and the two brothers).    - Alice\u2019s mother has **5 children** (Alice, her 3 sisters, and 1 brother).    - Therefore, the two maternal uncles have **2 children** in total (since 7 total nephews and nieces minus 5 from Alice\u2019s mother equals 2).  3. **Paternal Side**:    - Alice's father has:      - **1 brother** who has **1 son**.    - This uncle has **5 nephews and nieces**\u2014the children of his siblings.    - Since Alice's father and his brother are the only siblings, these nephews and nieces are Alice and her siblings.    - This implies Alice\u2019s family has **5 children** (matching the earlier count).  4. **Counting Cousins**:    - **Maternal Cousins**: The two maternal uncles have **2 children**.    - **Paternal Cousins**: The paternal uncle has **1 son**.    - **Total Cousins**: **2 maternal cousins** + **1 paternal cousin** = **3 cousins**.  ### Answer: 3",
