Alice's father's side:    - Alice's father has 2 sisters    - Alice's father has 1 brother    - This brother has 5 nephews and nieces in total    - This brother also has 1 daughter  4. To find Alice's sister's cousins, we need to count the children of Alice's aunts and uncles:     From mother's side:    - 2 uncles: We don't know if they have children or how many     From father's side:    - 2 aunts: We don't know if they have children or how many    - 1 uncle: We know he has 1 daughter  5.

The 6 nephews and nieces of Alice's aunt on her mother's side must be Alice, her siblings, and her cousin (the daughter of her father's brother).  7.
