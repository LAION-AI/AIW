        "model_response":"To solve this problem step by step, let's carefully consider the information provided:  1. **Alice and Bob are siblings**: Alice is a sister, and Bob is a brother.  2. **Alice has 2 sisters**: This means there are 2 girls in the family besides Alice. So, the total number of girls is **3** (Alice plus her 2 sisters).  3. **Bob has 2 brothers**: This means there are 2 boys in the family besides Bob. So, the total number of boys is **3** (Bob plus his 2 brothers).  4. **Total number of children**: Adding up the boys and girls, there are **6** children in the family (3 girls + 3 boys).  5. **Determining the number of brothers Alice has**:    - Since there are 3 boys in total (Bob and his 2 brothers), and they are all Alice's siblings, Alice has **3 brothers**.  ### Answer: Alice has 3 brothers.",
