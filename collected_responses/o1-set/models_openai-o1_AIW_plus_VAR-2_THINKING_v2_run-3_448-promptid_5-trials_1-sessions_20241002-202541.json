        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's carefully reconstruct Alice's family tree.  1. **Alice's Immediate Family**: Alice has 3 sisters. This means there are 4 children in Alice's immediate family (Alice + 3 sisters). The problem doesn't mention any brothers in Alice's immediate family, so we assume there are none.  2. **Maternal Side**:     - **Alice's Mother** has 1 sister (who has no children) and 2 brothers.     - The childless sister (Alice's maternal aunt) has 6 nephews and nieces. These are the children of her siblings (Alice's mother and her two brothers).     - Since Alice's mother has 4 daughters (Alice and her sisters), the 2 brothers must have 2 children between them (because 6 nephews and nieces minus the 4 daughters equals 2).     - Therefore, Alice has **2 cousins on her mother's side**.  3. **Paternal Side**:     - **Alice's Father** has a brother who has one son.     - This brother has 4 nephews and nieces.
