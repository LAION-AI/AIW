        "model_response":"Let's think through this step-by-step:  1. First, let's identify Alice's siblings:    - Alice has 2 sisters    - Alice has 1 brother    - So, Alice's family has 4 children in total (including Alice)  2. Now, let's look at Alice's mother's side:    - Alice's mother has 2 brothers    - Alice's mother has 1 sister (who has no children)    - The sister has 7 nephews and nieces in total  3. On Alice's father's side:    - Alice's father has 2 sisters    - Alice's father has 1 brother    - This brother has 5 nephews and nieces in total    - This brother also has 1 son  4. To find Alice's cousins, we need to count the children of her aunts and uncles:    - On mother's side:       * 2 uncles, but we don't know how many children they have    - On father's side:      * 2 aunts, but we don't know how many children they have      * 1 uncle who has 1 son  5. The key information is in the nephews and nieces count:    - Alice's mother's sister has 7 nephews and nieces    - These 7 must be Alice and her 3 siblings (4 total) plus 3 cousins from her mother's brothers  6. On the father's side:    - Alice's father's brother has 5 nephews and nieces    - These 5 must be Alice and her 3 siblings (4 total) plus 1 other cousin  7. So, the total number of Alice's cousins is:    - 3 from mother's side    - 1 from father's side (the son of her father's brother)    - Total: 4 cousins  8. The question asks about Alice's sister's cousins, which would be the same as Alice's cousins.  Therefore, Alice's sister has 4 cousins.  ### Answer: 4",

On Alice's father's side:    - Her father has 2 sisters    - Her father has 1 brother who has 1 son  4. To find Alice's sister's cousins, we need to count the children of Alice's aunts and uncles, excluding Alice and her siblings.  5. From the mother's side:    - We know Alice's aunt has no children    - We don't have information about children of Alice's two uncles from her mother's side  6. From the father's side:    - We know Alice's uncle has 1 son    - We don't have information about children of Alice's two aunts from her father's side  7. The only cousin we can confirm is the 1 son of Alice's uncle from her father's side  8. However, we have two pieces of additional information:    - Alice's aunt (mother's sister) has 7 nephews and nieces    - Alice's uncle (father's brother) has 5 nephews and nieces  9. The 7 nephews and nieces of Alice's aunt include Alice and her 3 siblings (4 total), leaving 3 other cousins from her mother's side  10. The 5 nephews and nieces of Alice's uncle include Alice and her 3 siblings (4 total), plus his own son (1), which accounts for all 5  11.

Looking at Alice's father's side:    - Alice's father has 2 sisters    - Alice's father has 1 brother    - Alice's father's brother has 5 nephews and nieces in total    - Alice's father's brother has 1 son  4.

Step 1: Determine the number of cousins from Alice's mother's side. - Alice's mother's brothers have a total of 7 nephews and nieces. - Since Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother, we subtract 4 from the total nephews and nieces to get the number of cousins. - Number of cousins from Alice's mother's side = 7 - 4 = 3 cousins  Step 2: Determine the number of cousins from Alice's father's side. - Alice's father's brother has 5 nephews and nieces in total. - Since Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother, we subtract 4 from the total nephews and nieces. - Number of cousins from Alice's father's brother = 5 - 4 = 1 cousin - Alice's father's brother also has 1 son, who is another cousin. - Total number of cousins from Alice's father's side = 1 + 1 = 2 cousins  Step 3: Calculate the total number of cousins Alice's sister has. - Total number of cousins = Cousins from mother's side + Cousins from father's side - Total number of cousins = 3 + 2 = 5 cousins  Double-checking the solution: - The calculation of cousins from Alice's mother's side is correct, as we subtracted Alice and her siblings from the total nephews and nieces. - The calculation of cousins from Alice's father's side is also correct, as we subtracted Alice and her siblings from the total nephews and nieces and added the son of Alice's father's brother. - The final sum of cousins from both sides is correct.  ### Answer: Alice's sister has 5 cousins.",
