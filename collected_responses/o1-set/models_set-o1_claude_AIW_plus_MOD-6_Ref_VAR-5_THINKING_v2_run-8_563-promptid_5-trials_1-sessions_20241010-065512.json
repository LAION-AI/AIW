        "model_response":"To determine how many cousins Alice's sister has, let's break down the information step by step:  1. **Alice's Immediate Family:**    - Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother.    - Total children in the family: 4 (Alice + 2 sisters + 1 brother).  2. **Mother's Side:**    - Alice's mother has 2 brothers (maternal uncles). However, there's no information about their children, so we'll assume they don't have any children for this problem.  3. **Father's Side:**    - Alice's father has 2 sisters and 1 brother (the uncle mentioned).    - The uncle (father's brother) has 1 son.    - The uncle also has 5 nephews and nieces in total. These nephews and nieces come from the children of his siblings:      - Alice and her siblings account for 4 (Alice + 2 sisters + 1 brother).      - Since the uncle has 5 nephews and nieces, it implies that one of the father's sisters has 1 child.  4. **Alice's Sister's Perspective:**    - The sister who doesn't have children has 6 nephews and nieces. These nephews and nieces are the children of her siblings, which primarily include Alice and her brother.    - This aligns with the uncle's information, confirming there are 5 nephews and nieces from the father's side.  5. **Cousins Calculation:**    - From the father's side: 1 son from the uncle and 1 child from the father's sisters, totaling 2 cousins.    - From the mother's side: No children are mentioned, so we assume there are 0 cousins from this side.  Therefore, Alice's sister has a total of **2 cousins**.  ### Answer: 2",

From the father's side:    - We know the father's brother has 1 son    - We don't have information about children of the father's 2 sisters  7.

The 5 nephews and nieces of father's brother must include Alice and her 3 siblings (4 total), plus 1 more    - This 1 must be a cousin from father's sisters  10.

        "model_response":"Let's think through this step by step:  1. First, let's identify Alice's siblings:    - Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother    - This means Alice's parents have 4 children in total  2. Now, let's look at Alice's mother's side:    - Her mother has 2 brothers    - Her mother has 1 sister with no children    - The sister has 6 nephews and nieces in total  3. Looking at Alice's father's side:    - Her father has 2 sisters    - Her father has 1 brother    - This brother has 5 nephews and nieces in total    - This brother also has 1 son  4. To find Alice's cousins, we need to count the children of her aunts and uncles:    - On mother's side:       * 2 uncles, but we don't know how many children they have    - On father's side:      * 2 aunts, but we don't know how many children they have      * 1 uncle with 1 son  5. The key information is:    - Alice's mother's sister has 6 nephews and nieces    - Alice's father's brother has 5 nephews and nieces  6. Since Alice and her 3 siblings account for 4 of these nephews and nieces on both sides, we can deduce:    - Mother's side: 6 - 4 = 2 cousins    - Father's side: 5 - 4 = 1 cousin (which is the son we know about)  7. Therefore, the total number of cousins is: 2 + 1 = 3  8. Remember, the question asks about Alice's sister's cousins, not Alice's. But since they are siblings, they have the same cousins.  After carefully checking this reasoning, we can provide the answer:  ### Answer: 3",

On Alice's father's side:    - Her father has 2 sisters    - Her father has 1 brother who has 1 son  4. To find Alice's sister's cousins, we need to count the children of Alice's aunts and uncles, excluding Alice and her siblings.  5.

From the father's side:    - We know the uncle has 1 son    - We don't have information about children from the 2 aunts  7. Additional information:    - Alice's mother's sister (aunt) has 6 nephews and nieces in total    - Alice's father's brother (uncle) has 5 nephews and nieces in total  8. Let's use this information:    - The 6 nephews and nieces of Alice's aunt include Alice and her 3 siblings    - The 5 nephews and nieces of Alice's uncle include Alice and her 3 siblings  9.

Alice's mother's side:    - Alice's mother has 2 brothers.    - Alice's mother also has 1 sister who does not have children.    - The sister has 6 nephews and nieces in total.    - Since Alice's mother's sister doesn't have children, the 6 nephews and nieces are from Alice's mother's 2 brothers.  3.
