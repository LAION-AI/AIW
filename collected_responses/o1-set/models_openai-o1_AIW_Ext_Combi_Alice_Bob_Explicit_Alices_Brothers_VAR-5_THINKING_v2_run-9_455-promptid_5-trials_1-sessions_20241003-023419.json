        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's analyze the information step by step:  1. **Alice and Bob are sister and brother**, meaning they are siblings in the same family.  2. **Alice has 2 sisters**:    - When someone says they have a certain number of sisters, they typically don't count themselves.    - Therefore, besides Alice herself, there are 2 other sisters.    - So, the total number of sisters in the family is **3** (Alice + 2 sisters).  3. **Bob has 3 brothers**:    - Similarly, Bob doesn't count himself when he says he has 3 brothers.    - So, besides Bob himself, there are 3 other brothers.    - Thus, the total number of brothers in the family is **4** (Bob + 3 brothers).  4. **Calculating the total siblings**:    - Total sisters: **3**    - Total brothers: **4**    - Total children in the family: **3 sisters + 4 brothers = 7 siblings**.  5. **Determining how many brothers Alice has**:    - Since Alice is one of the sisters, her siblings are the remaining sisters and all the brothers.    - She has **2 sisters** (already given) and **4 brothers** (as calculated).    - Therefore, **Alice has 4 brothers**.  ### Answer: 4",

        "model_response":"To find out how many brothers Alice has, let's carefully deduce from the given information:  1. **Alice and Bob are sister and brother**, meaning they are siblings in the same family.  2. **Alice has 2 sisters** (excluding herself), so there are a total of 3 sisters in the family (Alice plus her 2 sisters).  3. **Bob has 3 brothers** (excluding himself), so there are a total of 4 brothers in the family (Bob plus his 3 brothers).  4. The total number of children in the family is the sum of all sisters and brothers: \\(3 \\text{ sisters} + 4 \\text{ brothers} = 7 \\text{ children}\\).  5. Since Alice is one of the sisters, her brothers are all the male siblings in the family. Therefore, **Alice has 4 brothers**.  ### Answer: 4",
