Therefore:      - **Uncles (Mother's side)**: 2 Uncles.  3. **Alice's Sister\u2019s Children**:     - Alice also has a sister who doesn\u2019t have children, which we already noted.   4. **Alice's Mother's Nephews and Nieces**:    - Alice's sister (the one without children) has 6 nephews and nieces in total:      - Since Aunt Alice has 1 sister and each of her brothers (2 brothers) likely has children, this means:         - The 6 children (nephews and nieces) may stem from the 2 uncles on her mother\u2019s side.  5. **Alice's Father**:    - Alice's father has 2 sisters. Therefore:      - **Aunts (Father's side)**: 2 Aunts.  6. **Alice's Father's Brother**:    - He has 5 nephews and nieces and 2 sons.    - Since Alice is one of the children, the other children (siblings of Alice) also count as nieces\/nephews.     - Alice + Sibling + Brother = 3 children from Alice's father.    - This means the other brother must also have children to make the total count of nephews and nieces 5.    - Therefore, Alice's father has a brother who has 2 sons.  7. **Alice's Cousins**:    - **Cousins from Mother\u2019s side**: 6 children from her uncles (these are her cousins).    - **Cousins from Father\u2019s side**: Alice's father's brother has 2 children (these are also her cousins).    - Alice\u2019s total number of cousins would be:      - From Mother\u2019s side: 6      - From Father's side: 2       - Thus, total cousins = 6 (Mother's side) + 2 (Father's brother's sons) = 8 cousins.  8. **Alice's Sister**:    - Since Alice's sister is part of Alice's father and mother\u2019s children, she has the same number of cousins.    - Therefore, Alice's sister also has 8 cousins.  ### Final answer:  ### Answer: 8",

        "model_response":"Let's break down the problem step-by-step to find out how many cousins Alice\u2019s sister has.  1. **Identifying Alice's Siblings:**    - Alice has 1 sister and 1 brother.    - This means Alice is part of a family with 1 sister (let's call her Sister A) and 1 brother (let's call him Brother A).  2. **Understanding the Mother's Side:**    - Alice\u2019s mother has 2 brothers (let's call them Uncle 1 and Uncle 2).    - The problem states that Alice\u2019s sister (Sister A) has 6 nephews and nieces in total.    - Since Sister A does not have children, the 6 nephews and nieces must come from Alice\u2019s cousins.  3. **Finding Out About the Cousins:**    - Alice\u2019s cousins are the children of her mother\u2019s brothers.    - The 6 nephews and nieces that Sister A has must all be her cousins, since they are the children of Alice\u2019s uncles.    - We do not know how many children each uncle has, but collectively they must sum to 6.    - So, Alice has 6 cousins on her mother\u2019s side.  4. **Understanding the Father's Side:**    - Alice\u2019s father has 2 sisters (let\u2019s call them Aunt 1 and Aunt 2) and 1 brother.    - The brother of Alice\u2019s father has 5 nephews and nieces total (let's call him Uncle 3).    - This means Uncle 3's children, who are cousins of Alice, also contribute to her cousin count.  5. **Determining Total Cousins:**    - The total cousins of Alice would be the 6 from her mother's side plus any that come from her father's side.    - However, Uncle 3 has 2 sons. This means Alice has 2 more cousins from her father\u2019s side. Since Uncle 3 is the brother of Alice\u2019s father, his children (2 sons) are also Alice's cousins.  6. **Calculating Cousins:**    - Total cousins from mother\u2019s side: 6    - Total cousins from father\u2019s side: 2    - Total cousins that belong to Alice: 6 + 2 = 8.  Since Alice's sister (Sister A) has the same cousins as Alice, she also has 8 cousins.  ### Answer: 8",

        "model_response":"To determine how many cousins Alice's sister has, we'll analyze the family structure step by step.  1. **Alice's Family:**    - Alice has 1 sister and 1 brother. This means Alice's siblings are:      - Alice (herself)      - 1 sister      - 1 brother    - Total children in Alice's family: 3 (Alice, sister, brother).  2. **Alice's Mother:**    - Alice's mother has 2 brothers. This indicates that Alice has 2 maternal uncles.    - These uncles may have children (Alice's cousins).   3. **Alice's Maternal Uncles' Children:**    - The problem states Alice's mother has 1 sister who does not have children.    - However, her 2 brothers (the maternal uncles) may or may not have children. Since no specific number of children for these uncles is given, we cannot assume anything about their children yet.      - We learn Alice's mother's sister has 6 nephews and nieces in total. Since Alice is one of these nephews\/nieces (from one of her mother's brothers), and assuming Alice's siblings are also included:      - Since Alice, her sister, and brother constitute 3 of the nephews\/nieces, this means the remaining 3 must belong to the 2 uncles. Hence, collectively, the 2 uncles must have 3 children.  4. **Alice's Father:**    - Alice's father has 2 sisters (Alice's aunts) which could mean Alice could have more cousins from her father's side.    - Alice's father's brother has 5 nephews and nieces in total. Since this brother is also Alice's uncle, and since Alice, her sister, and brother count as three of these nephews\/nieces, this means the uncle must have 2 children (that is, they contribute to the count of 5 nephews and nieces represented).     Thus, the aunts contribute nothing further as the initial counts already account for Alice and her siblings.  5. **Counting Alice's Cousins:**    - From Alice\u2019s mother (2 uncles with 3 cousins).    - From Alice\u2019s father (1 brother with 2 cousins).  Adding both groups of cousins together: - Cousins from maternal side = 3 - Cousins from paternal side = 2 - Total = 3 + 2 = 5 cousins.  Therefore, Alice's sister has 5 cousins.  ### Answer: 5",

This means that these 6 nephews and nieces must belong to sisters or brothers of Alice's mother.    - Since Alice's mother has no sisters mentioned in the problem, we conclude that these nephews and nieces are the children of the 2 brothers.  4. **Alice's Father\u2019s Side**:    - Alice\u2019s father has 2 sisters and 1 brother.    - The brother has 5 nephews and nieces. Alice and her siblings are counted among these 5, as well as more children from Alice's father\u2019s sisters.  5. **Cousins from Alice's Father's Siblings**:    - Counting from Alice's father's sisters, each sister potentially could have children but this is not stated.    - The brother already has children (2 sons), we need to clarify how many children are with the 2 sisters.    - Since Alice's siblings have 5 cousins (the children of Alice's father's brother) and no direct children mentioned for Alice's father\u2019s sisters in context; thus, assume all are unaccounted.  6. **Final Cousin Count**:    - For Alice\u2019s sister, there are 2 cousins from Alice\u2019s father\u2019s brother (the boys).    - As for Alice\u2019s father\u2019s sisters, since no children are mentioned for them, we take them to have none.  Thus Alice's sister has a total of **2 cousins from her father's side**.  ### Answer: 2",

This means Alice has **2 uncles** on her mother's side.  3. **Alice's Mother's Sister**:    - Alice's sister is mentioned to have **6 nephews and nieces in total**. This means that Alice and her siblings (2) are included in this count. Therefore, the **6 nephews and nieces** must include:      - Alice and her siblings (3 total).      - There are **3 additional nephews and nieces** from the mother's side.  4. **Alice's Father**:    - Alice's father has **2 sisters**, so Alice has **2 aunts** on her father's side.    - Additionally, he has **1 brother** who has **5 nephews and nieces in total**. This includes Alice and her siblings. So:      - Total for father's brother = Alice (1) + siblings (2) + more (2) to make a total of 5. Therefore, this brother has **2 other siblings\/children (could be cousins)**.  5. **Counting Cousins**:    - Alice's cousins are from both sides:      - **From her mother's side**:        - **After Alice**: The mother's brothers likely have children too. We do not know the exact number but we know the totals include Alice and her siblings. Therefore, let's say 3 from Alice's family.      - **From her father's side**:        - Alice's father has **2 sisters**, potentially each with children. If we assume at least one each, that gives her **2 cousins** from her aunts.        - The father's brother's total of **5 known children** also suggests there are **2 additional cousins** not including Alice and her siblings.  Consolidating this information: - From the mother's side (brother's children = cousins) \u2013 totaling say, at least **7 cousins** on the mother's side (or fewer based on the arrangement). - From the father's side: her two aunts with at least one child each plus the brother's children - totals it to at least another **5 cousins**.  Final estimation for Alice's sister\u2019s cousins: - Sum of cousins from Alice's mother and father gives a broadly defined list but the exact count should be clear:     So with this thought process, let's assume: - Total cousins of Alice (and thus, her sister): - Total immediate family counts + extended family could be around **7 from both sides**.  ### Answer: 7",

        "model_response":"To determine how many cousins Alice's sister has, we need to consider both sides of Alice's family: the maternal and paternal sides.  ### Maternal Side 1. Alice's mother has 2 brothers. 2. Each of Alice's mother's brothers could potentially have children. The problem does not specify the exact number of children each brother has, so we need to consider the possibility that any of these children would be Alice's (and therefore Alice's sister's) cousins.  ### Paternal Side 1. Alice's father has 2 sisters. 2. Alice's father's brother has 5 nephews and nieces in total. Since these 5 include Alice, her sister, and her brother, the calculation for their children goes as follows:    - Alice + her sister + 1 brother = 3 (Alice's family members).    - Thus, 5 (total nephews and nieces) - 3 (Alice, her sister, brother) = 2 other nephews\/nieces who are Alice's cousins. 3. Alice's father's brother also has 2 sons, who are Alice's cousins as well.  ### Summing up cousins: 1. From paternal uncle: 2 cousins (nephews\/nieces other than Alice\u2019s siblings) + 2 sons = 4 cousins. 2. Alice's mother\u2019s side does not indicate any children from her mother\u2019s brothers, so we do not add any additional cousins from here.  Thus, Alice's sister has 4 cousins.  ### Answer: 4 ",

        "model_response":"To find the number of cousins that Alice's sister has, we need to determine the number of children that Alice's aunts and uncles have. Let's break this down step by step.  1. **Alice's Immediate Family:**    - Alice has 1 sister and 1 brother. Since these siblings are not cousins, we don't count them in this calculation.  2. **Alice's Maternal Side:**    - Alice's mother has 2 brothers.      - Since Alice's mother's sister has no children, any children of these brothers will be Alice's maternal cousins.      - Alice\u2019s mother\u2019s sister has 6 nephews and nieces in total. These nephews and nieces must be Alice and her siblings, as her sister does not have children. Therefore, Alice's mother's brothers do not have children.      - Thus, no maternal cousins from Alice's mother's side.  3. **Alice's Paternal Side:**    - Alice\u2019s father has 2 sisters.      - The children of these sisters (if any) would be Alice\u2019s paternal cousins.      - Information on children of Alice's paternal aunts is not given.    - Alice\u2019s father also has a brother who has 2 sons.      - This brother has 5 nephews and nieces in total, which confirms the children among broader family connections.      - These nephews and nieces must include the 3 children of Alice (Alice, her sister, and her brother) and the 2 sons of Alice\u2019s father\u2019s brother.      - So, the remaining 2 nephews and nieces of Alice\u2019s father\u2019s brother are his own sons.      - Thus, Alice has 2 cousins (the sons of Alice's father\u2019s brother) on her father\u2019s side.  Putting it all together: - On Alice\u2019s mother\u2019s side: 0 cousins. - On Alice\u2019s father\u2019s side: 2 cousins.  Since Alice\u2019s sister has the same number of cousins as Alice, Alice\u2019s sister has \\(2\\) cousins.  ### Answer: 2",
