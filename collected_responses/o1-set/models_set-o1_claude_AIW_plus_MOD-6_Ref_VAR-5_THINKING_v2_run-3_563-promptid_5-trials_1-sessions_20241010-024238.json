We can use this information to determine the number of children Alice's mother's brothers have.  Alice's mother's sister has 6 nephews and nieces in total: - Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother (3 siblings in total). - Alice's father's brother has 1 son. So, the number of children Alice's mother's brothers have is: 6 - 3 - 1 = 2  Therefore, the total number of cousins Alice's sister has is: - From Alice's mother's side: 2 - From Alice's father's side: 1 Total: 2 + 1 = 3  Double-checking the solution: - The total number of nephews and nieces for Alice's mother's sister (6) and Alice's father's brother (5) adds up to 11. - Alice and her siblings (3), plus Alice's father's brother's son (1), plus the cousins from Alice's mother's side (2) and father's side (1) also add up to 11. This confirms that the solution is correct.  ### Answer: 3",

        "model_response":"Let's solve this problem step by step:  1. Alice's family:    * Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother.    * In total, Alice's parents have 4 children (Alice + 2 sisters + 1 brother).  2. Alice's mother's side:    * Alice's mother has 2 brothers.    * Alice's mother also has 1 sister who does not have children.    * The sister has 6 nephews and nieces in total.    * Since Alice's mother has 4 children, the remaining 2 nephews and nieces must be from her 2 brothers.  3. Alice's father's side:    * Alice's father has 2 sisters.    * Alice's father also has a brother who has 5 nephews and nieces in total.    * The brother also has 1 son.    * Since the brother has 1 son, the remaining 4 nephews and nieces must be from Alice's father's 2 sisters.  4. Counting Alice's sister's cousins:    * From Alice's mother's side:      - The 2 nephews and nieces from Alice's mother's brothers are Alice's sister's cousins.    * From Alice's father's side:      - The brother's son is Alice's sister's cousin.      - The 4 nephews and nieces from Alice's father's sisters are Alice's sister's cousins.    * In total, Alice's sister has 2 + 1 + 4 = 7 cousins.
