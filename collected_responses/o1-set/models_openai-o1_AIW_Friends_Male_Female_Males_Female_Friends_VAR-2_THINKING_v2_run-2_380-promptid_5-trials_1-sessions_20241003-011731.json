        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step to avoid any mistakes:  1. **Individuals Involved**:    - **Alice**    - **2 female friends** (let's call them F1 and F2)    - **4 male friends** (let's call them M1, M2, M3, M4)  2. **Friendship Relations**:    - They all are friends with each other. This means every person is friends with every other person in the group.    - They have no other friends aside from this group.  3. **Total Group Size**:    - **Total individuals** = Alice + 2 female friends + 4 male friends = **7 people**  4. **Focus on a Male Friend**:    - We need to determine the number of female friends that a **male friend of Alice** has.    - Since all male friends are in the same position, we can choose any one of them (let's choose M1 for simplicity).  5. **Friends of M1**:    - M1 is friends with everyone else in the group because they all are friends with each other.    - So, M1's friends are:      - **Alice** (female)      - **F1** (female)      - **F2** (female)      - **M2**, **M3**, **M4** (male)  6. **Counting Female Friends of M1**:    - M1 has **three female friends**: Alice, F1, and F2.  ### Answer: 3",

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's carefully analyze the information provided:  1. **Alice has 2 female friends and 4 male friends.** 2. **All of these friends are friends with each other.** 3. **They have no other friends outside this group.**  This means the entire group consists of:  - Alice - 2 female friends - 4 male friends  Totaling **7 people** in the group.  Since everyone in this group is friends with one another, each person is friends with the other 6 people.  Now, let's focus on **one of Alice's male friends**.
