        "model_response":"Let's work through the problem step by step to determine how many brothers Alice has.  1. **Understanding the Relationships:**    - **Alice and Bob** are siblings, with Alice being the sister and Bob being the brother.  2. **Interpreting the Given Information:**    - **Alice has 3 sisters.**      - This means Alice has 3 sisters *in addition to herself*. Therefore, the total number of sisters is:        \\[        \\text{Total Sisters} = 1 \\, (\\text{Alice}) + 3 = 4        \\]    - **Bob has 6 brothers.**      - This means Bob has 6 brothers *in addition to himself*. Therefore, the total number of brothers is:        \\[        \\text{Total Brothers} = 1 \\, (\\text{Bob}) + 6 = 7        \\]  3. **Determining Alice's Number of Brothers:**    - Since the total number of brothers is 7 (including Bob), Alice has:      \\[      \\text{Alice's Brothers} = 7      \\]  ### Answer: 7",
