        "model_response":"To determine the number of cousins Alice's sister has, let's break down the family tree step by step.  **Alice's Immediate Family:** - Alice has **4 sisters**, so there are **5 daughters** in total in Alice's family.  **On Alice's Mother's Side:** - Alice's mother has:   - **1 sister** who **does not have children**.   - **2 brothers**. - The sister (Alice's aunt) has **6 nephews and nieces**. Since she doesn't have children of her own, these must be the children of her siblings.   - Alice's mother has **5 daughters** (Alice and her sisters).   - This means the **2 brothers have 1 child in total** (6 - 5 = 1). - So, from her mother's side, Alice's sister has **1 cousin**.  **On Alice's Father's Side:** - Alice's father has **1 brother** who:   - Has **1 son**.   - Has **5 nephews and nieces**. These are Alice and her sisters. - No other siblings are mentioned, so there are no additional children on this side. - So, from her father's side, Alice's sister has **1 cousin**.  **Total Cousins:** - **1 cousin** from the mother's side. - **1 cousin** from the father's side. - Therefore, Alice's sister has **2 cousins**.  ### Answer: 2",

        "model_response":"To solve this problem step by step:  **On the maternal side (mother's family):**  - Alice's mother has:   - 1 sister who is childless.   - 2 brothers.    - The childless sister has 6 nephews and nieces. She is childless herself, so these nephews and nieces must be the children of her siblings (Alice's mother and her two brothers).  - Since Alice's mother has 5 daughters (Alice and her 4 sisters), and the total number of nieces and nephews is 6, it means the two brothers have only 1 child between them.  - Therefore, on the maternal side, Alice and her sisters have **1 cousin** (the child of one of the maternal uncles).  **On the paternal side (father's family):**  - Alice's father has:   - 1 brother who has 1 son.  - This brother has 5 nephews and nieces, which must be the children of his siblings. Since the only sibling mentioned is Alice's father, and Alice's father has 5 children (Alice and her 4 sisters), these are the 5 nephews and nieces.  - Therefore, on the paternal side, Alice and her sisters have **1 cousin** (the son of their paternal uncle).  **In total:**  - **1 maternal cousin** (from mother's side). - **1 paternal cousin** (from father's side).
