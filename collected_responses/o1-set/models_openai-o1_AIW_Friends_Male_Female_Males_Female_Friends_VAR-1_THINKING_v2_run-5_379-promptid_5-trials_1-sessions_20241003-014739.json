        "model_response":"To solve this problem step by step:  1. **Total Number of Friends**: Alice has \\(3\\) male friends and \\(6\\) female friends, totaling \\(9\\) friends besides herself.  2. **Friendship Among Alice's Friends**: All of Alice's friends are friends with each other. This means every friend (male or female) is connected to every other friend.  3. **Exclusivity of Friendships**: They have no friends outside this group. So the social circle is closed among these \\(9\\) friends.  4. **Friends of a Male Friend**:    - Each male friend is friends with:      - **Alice**      - The **2 other male friends**      - The **6 female friends**    - So, a male friend has a total of \\(1 + 2 + 6 = 9\\) friends (excluding himself).  5. **Number of Female Friends**: Out of these \\(9\\) friends, the number of female friends is \\(6\\).  ### Answer: 6",
