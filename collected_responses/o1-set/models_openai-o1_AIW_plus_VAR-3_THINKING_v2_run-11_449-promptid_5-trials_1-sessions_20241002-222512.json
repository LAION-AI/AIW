        "model_response":"To determine how many cousins Alice's sister has, we'll reconstruct Alice's family tree step by step.  **1. Alice's Immediate Family:** - Alice has **3 sisters**. So, there are **4 daughters** in Alice's immediate family (including Alice herself).  **2. Alice's Mother's Side:** - Alice's mother has:   - **1 sister** who **does not have children**.   - **2 brothers**. - The aunt (mother's sister who has no children) has **7 nephews and nieces**. Since she has no children, these are the children of her siblings (Alice's mother and the two brothers). - Alice's mother has **4 daughters** (Alice and her sisters), so the **2 brothers must have a total of 3 children** to make up the 7 nephews and nieces. - Therefore, on Alice's mother's side, there are **3 cousins** (children of the two maternal uncles).  **3. Alice's Father's Side:** - Alice's father has:   - **1 brother** (Uncle) who has **1 son**.   - **1 sister**. - The uncle has **5 nephews and nieces**.

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of cousins Alice's sister has by analyzing both her maternal and paternal relatives.  **Maternal Side:** 1. Alice's mother has:    - 1 sister who has no children.    - 2 brothers.  2. The aunt (Alice's mother's sister who has no children) has **7 nephews and nieces**. These are the children of her siblings (Alice's mother and her two brothers).  3. Alice's mother has **4 daughters** (Alice and her 3 sisters).  4. Therefore, the two maternal uncles must have a total of **3 children** because \\(7 (total nephews\/nieces) - 4 (Alice and sisters) = 3\\).  5. So, on the maternal side, Alice's sister has **3 cousins** (children of the two maternal uncles).  **Paternal Side:** 1. Alice's father has a brother who:    - Has **1 son**.    - Has **5 nephews and nieces**.  2. The paternal uncle's nephews and nieces are the children of his siblings. Since Alice's father has **4 daughters** (Alice and her sisters), we account for **4 nieces**.  3. The uncle has **5 nephews and nieces**, so there must be another sibling (paternal aunt or uncle) with **1 child** because \\(5 (total nephews\/nieces) - 4 (Alice and sisters) = 1\\).  4. Therefore, on the paternal side, Alice's sister has **2 cousins** (the son of the paternal uncle and the child of the other sibling).  **Total Cousins:** Adding the maternal and paternal cousins: \\[ 3 (maternal cousins) + 2 (paternal cousins) = 5 \\]  ### Answer: 5",
