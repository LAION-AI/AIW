        "model_response":"To solve this problem step-by-step:  1. **Alice's immediate family**:    - Alice has **2 sisters**.    - Assuming no other siblings are mentioned, we can infer that Alice's parents have **5 children**: Alice, her **2 sisters**, and potentially **2 brothers** (since the father's brother has **5 nephews and nieces**, suggesting Alice's father has 5 children).  2. **Mother's side**:    - Alice's mother has:      - **1 sister** (who has no children).      - **2 brothers**.    - The childless sister has **6 nephews and nieces**. These are the children of her siblings (Alice's mother and her two brothers).    - Since Alice's mother has **5 children**, the two uncles together must have **1 child** (since 6 - 5 = 1).    - Therefore, Alice has **1 cousin** on her mother's side.  3. **Father's side**:    - Alice's father has a brother who has:      - **2 daughters** (Alice's cousins).      - **5 nephews and nieces** (the children of his siblings).    - If Alice's father and his brother are the only siblings, then the **5 nephews and nieces** are Alice and her siblings.    - Therefore, Alice has **2 cousins** on her father's side.  4. **Total cousins**:    - Alice has **1 maternal cousin** and **2 paternal cousins**.    - So, Alice's sister (being in the same immediate family) also has **3 cousins**.  ### Answer: 3",

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we'll carefully reconstruct Alice's family tree based on the given information.  1. **Alice's Immediate Family:**    - Alice has **2 sisters**. There is no mention of brothers, so we'll assume she has none. This means Alice's parents have **3 daughters**.  2. **Alice's Mother's Side:**    - Alice's mother has:      - **1 sister** who is childless.      - **2 brothers**.    - The childless sister has **6 nephews and nieces**. These are the children of her siblings, which include Alice's mother and her two brothers.    - Since Alice's mother has **3 daughters**, the remaining **3 nephews\/nieces** must be the children of her two brothers.    - Therefore, Alice has **3 maternal cousins** (children of her uncles on her mother's side).  3. **Alice's Father's Side:**    - Alice's father has **1 brother** (Uncle Bob).    - Uncle Bob has:      - **2 daughters**.      - **5 nephews and nieces**.    - The nephews and nieces are the children of Uncle Bob's siblings. Since the problem doesn't mention any other siblings of Alice's father, we'll assume Alice's father is his only sibling.    - Therefore, the **5 nephews and nieces** are Alice and her sisters (3 girls) plus **2 brothers** (since Uncle Bob has 5 nephews and nieces in total).    - But we've established that Alice has no brothers. This suggests our assumption that Alice's father has only one sibling might be incorrect. Perhaps Alice's father has another sibling whose children are nephews\/nieces to Uncle Bob.    - However, lacking information about other siblings, and since the problem focuses only on Uncle Bob, we'll proceed with the assumption that Alice has only **2 sisters** and that Uncle Bob's nephews and nieces include other cousins not directly related to Alice.  4. **Counting Alice's Cousins:**    - **Maternal cousins:** 3 (from her mother's brothers).    - **Paternal cousins:** 2 (Uncle Bob's daughters).    - **Total cousins:** 3 (maternal) + 2 (paternal) = **5 cousins**.  ### Answer: 5",
