We need to count the children of Alice's aunts and uncles, excluding Alice and her siblings:     From mother's side:    - Mother's 2 brothers: We don't know how many children they have.    - Mother's sister: Has no children.     From father's side:    - Father's 2 sisters: We don't know how many children they have.    - Father's brother: Has 2 sons.  5. We're told that Alice's mother's sister (who has no children) has 6 nephews and nieces in total.    These 6 include Alice and her 2 siblings, so there are 3 other nephews\/nieces.    These 3 must be the children of Alice's mother's 2 brothers.  6. We're also told that Alice's father's brother has 5 nephews and nieces in total.    These 5 include Alice and her 2 siblings, plus his own 2 sons.    This means there are no other nephews\/nieces from this side of the family.  7.

We know 3 of these are Alice and her siblings, and 2 are his own sons.    This means Alice's father's 2 sisters don't have any children.  7.

Let's break this down:    - 3 of these are Alice and her siblings (remember, Alice's parents have 3 children).    - That leaves 2 other nephews\/nieces, which must be children of Alice's father's sisters.  9.

Looking at Alice's father's side:    - Alice's father has 2 sisters    - Alice's father has 1 brother    - This brother has 5 nephews and nieces in total    - This brother also has 2 sons  4.

        "model_response":"Let's break down the problem and solve it step by step.  Given: - Alice has 1 sister and 1 brother. - Alice's mother has 2 brothers. - Alice's mother has 1 sister who does not have children and has 6 nephews and nieces in total. - Alice's father has 2 sisters. - Alice's father has a brother who has 5 nephews and nieces in total and 2 sons.  Step 1: Find the number of cousins Alice's sister has from her mother's side. - Alice's mother's brothers' children are Alice's sister's cousins. - We don't know the exact number of children Alice's mother's brothers have, but we can calculate it. - Alice's mother's sister has 6 nephews and nieces in total, which includes Alice, her sister, and her brother. - So, the number of children Alice's mother's brothers have = 6 - 3 = 3 cousins from the mother's side.  Step 2: Find the number of cousins Alice's sister has from her father's side. - Alice's father's sisters' children are Alice's sister's cousins. - We don't know the exact number of children Alice's father's sisters have. - Alice's father's brother has 5 nephews and nieces in total, which includes his own 2 sons. - So, the number of children Alice's father's sisters have = 5 - 2 = 3 cousins from the father's side.  Step 3: Add the number of cousins from both sides. Total number of cousins Alice's sister has = Cousins from mother's side + Cousins from father's side Total number of cousins Alice's sister has = 3 + 3 = 6  Double-checking the solution: - The total number of nephews and nieces for Alice's mother's sister (6) and Alice's father's brother (5) adds up to 11. - This includes Alice, her sister, her brother, and Alice's father's brother's 2 sons, which is a total of 5. - So, the remaining 6 must be Alice's sister's cousins, which matches our calculation.  ### Answer: Alice's sister has 6 cousins.",

        "model_response":"Okay, let's think this through step by step:  1. Alice has 1 sister and 1 brother. This means that Alice's sister has 1 brother (Alice's brother).  2. Alice's mother has 2 brothers. The children of these brothers would be Alice's sister's cousins. However, we don't know how many children each of these brothers has.  3. Alice's mother also has 1 sister who does not have children. This sister has 6 nephews and nieces in total. These nephews and nieces would be the children of Alice's mother's brothers (from step 2). Therefore, the 2 brothers of Alice's mother have 6 children in total, which are cousins to Alice's sister.  4. Alice's father has 2 sisters. The children of these sisters would also be cousins to Alice's sister. However, we don't know how many children each of these sisters has.  5. Alice's father also has a brother who has 5 nephews and nieces in total. These nephews and nieces would be the children of Alice's father's sisters (from step 4) and Alice's father's brother's own children. We know that Alice's father's brother has 2 sons, so the remaining 3 nephews and nieces must be the children of Alice's father's sisters.
