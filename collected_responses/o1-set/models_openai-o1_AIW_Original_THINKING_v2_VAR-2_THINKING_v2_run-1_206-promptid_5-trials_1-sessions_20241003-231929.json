        "model_response":"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:  1. **Determine the total number of sisters:**    - Alice has **2 sisters** in addition to herself.    - This means there are a total of **3 sisters** in the family (Alice + 2 sisters).  2. **Understand the total number of children:**    - **3 sisters** (from step 1).    - **4 brothers** (as given).    - **Total children in the family**: 3 sisters + 4 brothers = **7 children**.  3. **Find out how many sisters Alice's brother has:**    - Each brother has the same siblings.    - Each brother has **3 sisters** (Alice and her 2 sisters).    - Therefore, Alice's brother has **3 sisters**.  ### Answer: 3",
