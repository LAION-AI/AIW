        "model_response":"Let's think through this step-by-step:  1. First, we need to identify Alice's aunts and uncles:    - From her mother's side: 2 uncles, 1 aunt (without children)    - From her father's side: 2 aunts, 1 uncle (with 1 daughter)  2. Now, let's count the children of these aunts and uncles:    - Mother's side:      - The aunt has no children      - We don't have information about children of the 2 uncles    - Father's side:      - We know the uncle has 1 daughter      - We don't have information about children of the 2 aunts  3. We're told that Alice's mother's sister (aunt) has 6 nephews and nieces in total.    Alice and her siblings account for 5 of these (Alice, 1 sister, 3 brothers).    This means there's 1 more nephew\/niece from another sibling of Alice's mother.  4. We're also told that Alice's father's brother (uncle) has 5 nephews and nieces in total.    Alice and her siblings account for all 5 of these (Alice, 1 sister, 3 brothers).  5. So, the only confirmed cousin we can count is the 1 daughter of Alice's father's brother.  6. The question asks about Alice's sister's cousins, but since they are siblings, they have the same cousins.  Therefore, based on the information given, we can only confirm one cousin.  ### Answer: 1",

First, let's identify Alice's siblings:    - Alice has 1 sister and 3 brothers    - This means Alice's parents have 5 children in total  2.

Looking at Alice's father's side:    - Her father has 2 sisters    - Her father has 1 brother    - This brother has 5 nephews and nieces in total    - This brother also has 1 daughter  4.

Therefore, we cannot determine the exact number of cousins Alice's sister has. We only know for certain that she has at least 1 cousin (the daughter of Alice's paternal uncle).

First, let's identify Alice's siblings:    - Alice has 1 sister and 3 brothers    - This means there are 5 children in Alice's family (including Alice)  2. Now, let's look at Alice's mother's side:    - Her mother has 2 brothers    - Her mother has 1 sister with no children    - The sister has 6 nephews and nieces in total  3. On Alice's father's side:    - Her father has 2 sisters    - Her father has 1 brother    - This brother has 5 nephews and nieces and 1 daughter  4. To find Alice's sister's cousins, we need to count the children of Alice's aunts and uncles:        From mother's side:    - 2 uncles: We don't know how many children they have    - 1 aunt: No children     From father's side:    - 2 aunts: We don't know how many children they have    - 1 uncle: We know he has 1 daughter  5. The key information is:    - Alice's mother's sister (aunt) has 6 nephews and nieces    - Alice's father's brother (uncle) has 5 nephews and nieces  6. Since we know there are 5 children in Alice's family:    - The 6 nephews and nieces of the mother's sister must include Alice and her 4 siblings    - This means there is 1 additional cousin from the mother's side (6 - 5 = 1)  7. On the father's side:    - The 5 nephews and nieces of the father's brother must be Alice and her 4 siblings    - We know this uncle has 1 daughter, who is a cousin  8. Therefore, the total number of cousins is:    1 (from mother's side) + 1 (from father's side) = 2  After careful consideration and double-checking, I believe this is the correct solution.  ### Answer: 2",

We know that Alice's mother's sister has 6 nephews and nieces in total. This includes:    - Alice    - Alice's sister    - Alice's 3 brothers    That's 5 from Alice's family, so there must be 1 more cousin from one of the mother's brothers.  4. We also know that Alice's father's brother has 5 nephews and nieces in total. This includes:    - Alice    - Alice's sister    - Alice's 3 brothers    That's all 5, so this uncle doesn't have any other children besides the 1 daughter mentioned.  5. So far, we've counted 2 cousins:    - 1 from mother's side    - 1 from father's side (the daughter of father's brother)  6. We don't have any information about children from Alice's father's sisters or her other maternal uncle.  7. The question asks about Alice's sister's cousins, not Alice's cousins. However, Alice and her sister would have the same cousins.  Therefore, based on the information given, we can confirm that Alice's sister has at least 2 cousins. There could be more, but we don't have enough information to determine that.  ### Answer: 2",

This means that Alice's mother's brothers and father's sisters don't have any children. If they did, the number of nephews and nieces for Alice's mother's sister would be higher than 6.  6.

Let's carefully dissect the information:  1. **Alice's Immediate Family:**    - Alice has **1 sister** and **3 brothers**.    - Therefore, Alice's parents have **5 children** (including Alice).  2. **Maternal Side (Mother's Siblings):**    - Alice's mother has:      - **2 brothers** (MB1 and MB2).      - **1 sister** (MAunt) who *does not have children*.    - MAunt has **6 nephews and nieces**.      - MAunt's nephews and nieces are the children of her siblings (Alice's mother, MB1, and MB2).      - Since Alice's mother has **5 children**, MB1 and MB2 together must have **1 child** (because 5 + number of MB1 and MB2's children = 6).    - **Conclusion**: On the maternal side, Alice has **1 cousin** (the child of MB1 or MB2).  3. **Paternal Side (Father's Siblings):**    - Alice's father has:      - **2 sisters** (PA1 and PA2).      - **1 brother** (PB1) who has **1 daughter**.      - PB1 has **5 nephews and nieces**.        - PB1's nephews and nieces are the children of his siblings (Alice's father, PA1, and PA2).        - Since Alice's father has **5 children** and the total nephews and nieces are **5**, PA1 and PA2 must have **no children**.    - **Conclusion**: On the paternal side, Alice has **1 cousin** (the daughter of PB1).  4. **Total Cousins:**    - **Maternal Cousins**: **1**    - **Paternal Cousins**: **1**    - **Total Cousins**: **1 + 1 = 2**  Therefore, Alice's sister has **2 cousins**.  ### Answer: 2",

        "model_response":"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of cousins Alice's sister has by analyzing the family relationships provided.  **Step 1: Alice's Immediate Family** - Alice has 1 sister and 3 brothers, making a total of 5 siblings (including Alice herself).  **Step 2: Maternal Side** - Alice's mother has 2 brothers and 1 sister. - The sister (Alice's aunt) has no children and has 6 nephews and nieces in total. These nephews and nieces are the children of her siblings (Alice's mother and her two brothers). - Alice's mother has 5 children (Alice and her siblings). - Therefore, the two brothers must have 1 child collectively (since 5 [from Alice's mother] + 1 [from the uncles] = 6 nephews and nieces). - This means Alice has **1 maternal cousin**.  **Step 3: Paternal Side** - Alice's father has 2 sisters and 1 brother. - The brother (Alice's uncle) has 1 daughter and 5 nephews and nieces in total. - The nephews and nieces are the children of his siblings (Alice's father and the two sisters). - Alice's father has 5 children (Alice and her siblings). - Since the uncle has 5 nephews and nieces, the two sisters do not have children (as adding any more children would increase the number beyond 5). - This means Alice has **1 paternal cousin** (the uncle's daughter).  **Step 4: Total Number of Cousins** - Total cousins = Maternal cousins + Paternal cousins = 1 + 1 = **2**  ### Answer: 2",

        "model_response":"Let's think through this step by step:  1. Alice has 1 sister and 3 brothers, so there are 5 siblings in total in her family.  2. Alice's mother has 2 brothers. The children of these brothers would be Alice's cousins. However, we don't know how many children each of these brothers has.  3. Alice's mother also has 1 sister who doesn't have children. This sister has 6 nephews and nieces in total. Since Alice's mother has 5 children (Alice, her sister, and her 3 brothers), the remaining 1 niece or nephew must be from one of the mother's brothers. So, one of the mother's brothers has at least 1 child.  4. Alice's father has 2 sisters. The children of these sisters would also be Alice's cousins. Again, we don't know how many children each of these sisters has.  5. Alice's father also has a brother who has 1 daughter. This daughter is Alice's cousin. The father's brother also has 5 nephews and nieces in total. Since he has 1 daughter, the remaining 4 must be from Alice's father's sisters. So, the father's sisters have at least 4 children combined.  6. To find the number of cousins Alice's sister has, we need to count the total number of cousins. Alice's cousins are:    - Children of her mother's 2 brothers (number unknown)    - 1 child from one of her mother's brothers    - Children of her father's 2 sisters (at least 4)    - 1 daughter of her father's brother  So, the total number of cousins is at least 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 7.  7. Alice's sister has the same cousins as Alice.  Double-checking the steps, the reasoning seems correct. The key points are: - Alice's mother's childless sister's nephews and nieces include Alice, her sister, and her brothers, plus 1 more from one of the mother's brothers. - Alice's father's brother's nephews and nieces include his own daughter, plus 4 more from the father's sisters.  ### Answer: Alice's sister has at least 7 cousins.",
