        "model_response":"To solve this problem systematically, let's break down the information:  1. **Alice and Bob are sister and brother.**    - This means they are siblings in the same family.  2. **Alice has 2 sisters.**    - Including herself, there are a total of 3 girls in the family (Alice + 2 sisters).  3. **Bob has 3 brothers.**    - Including himself, there are a total of 4 boys in the family (Bob + 3 brothers).  4. **Total number of children in the family:**    - Total girls: 3 (from point 2).    - Total boys: 4 (from point 3).    - Total children = 3 girls + 4 boys = **7 children**.  5. **Number of brothers Alice has:**    - Since Alice is one of the girls, her brothers are all the boys in the family.    - Total brothers = Total boys = 4 (from point 3).    - Therefore, **Alice has 4 brothers**.  ### Answer: 4",
