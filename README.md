### Collect experiments data

#### Collect using [LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm)
Refer to the [LiteLLM Docs](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/) on how to setup your account and API keys.

Refer to [this bash script](scripts/execute_litellm_data_gathering.sh) to see how to use litellm to gather model responses.

#### Collect using [TogetherAI](https://www.together.ai/)

Refer to the [TogetherAI Docs](https://docs.together.ai/docs/quickstart) on how to setup your account and API keys.

Refer to [this Python script](data_collection/examples/example_together.py) to see how to use togetherAI to gather model responses.

#### Colect by scraping [LMSYS Chatbot Arena](https://chat.lmsys.org/) 
**Important note** This method is not recommended since it's limited and can violate LMSYS' ToS.

Refer to [this bash script](scripts/execute_lmsys_data_gathering.sh) to see how to use litellm to gather model responses.


## Plot the data
